 be required based on design geometry or for dynamically loaded structures.
 When notch toughness is required, the supplementary requirements of the ASTM
 specification for the steel being considered should be reviewed and the appropriate
 supplementary requirements (ASTM A6/A6M) specified. In designs where the material
 will be exposed to temperatures below freezing, check the material type against
 the proposed ambient and working temperatures for resistance to brittle fracture.

 NOTE: Indicate the location of test welds and types of testing desired. The

 small surface defects by enhancing the visibility of the flaw. Magnetic particle
 testing detects surface cracks and near-surface cracks; this test provides more
 information than the dye penetrant testing, and for approximately the same cost.
 Ultrasonic testing detect surface and internal cracks, delaminations, lack of
 fusion, and density and thickness variations. Generally, fillet welds can only
 be dye penetrant or magnetic particle tested. All complete penetration welds
 should be ultrasonically tested. See AWS D1.1/D1.1M for other methods of NDT
