<PRT><TTL>PART 1   GENERAL</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This specification section was constructed to support Total Building 
Commissioning in accordance with UFC 1-200-02 using a commissioning specialist 
hired by the General/Prime Contractor.  Although the Government is the actual 
commissioning authority, the contractor hired commissioning specialist will 
serve as the commissioning authority for sustainability Third Party Certification 
(TPC) such as LEED or Green Globes.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
UFC 1-200-02 requires compliance with the commissioning requirements of ASHRAE 
189.1 including the commissioning of the systems identified therein.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Specifier must edit or add content as appropriate to accommodate any additional 
systems or additional activities for Third Party Certification (TPC) if required 
for the project.  The requirements herein satisfy LEED requirements but may 
need to be augmented for Green Globes requirements or points.  <BRK/>
<BRK/>
This specification is intended to be provided with design-bid-build construction specifications.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Very small or non-complex projects may not require commissioning to the extent 
called for in this specification section.  In such cases, coordinate with the 
Government PM to determine the appropriate level of commissioning and edit the 
specification accordingly.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Several tailoring options are included in this specification.  In some cases, 
the Navy assigns Government Acceptance Engineers to projects.  In this case, 
select the tailoring option for NAVY ACCEPTANCE ENGINEER.  When the Navy does 
not assign an Acceptance Engineer for a Navy project, select the tailoring option 
for NO ACCEPTANCE ENGINEER.  When the project uses specification section 
<SRF>23 09 00</SRF>, select the associated tailoring option.    Select the NAVY tailoring 
option for all Navy projects and the AIR FORCE or ARMY tailoring option for 
Air Force or Army projects. Select DESIGN-BUILD for design-build projects and 
DESIGN-BID-BUILD for design-bid-build projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
If the project will include building envelope commissioning beyond the requirements 
of Specification Sections <SRF>07 27 10.00 10</SRF> BUILDING AIR BARRIER SYSTEM or 
<SRF>07 05 23</SRF> PRESSURE TESTING AN AIR BARRIER SYSTEM FOR AIR TIGHTNESS, select the 
BUILDING ENVELOPE COMMISSIONING tailoring option.  If the project will not include 
a building air barrier or additional commissioning is not required, deselect 
the BUILDING ENVELOPE COMMISSIONING tailoring option.  Coordinate with the Government 
PM to determine if additional commissioning is required or will be funded.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Some minor formatting and grammar corrections and relabeled appendices may be 
needed after making bracketed selections or applying tailoring options.</NPR><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>SUMMARY</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Commission the building systems listed herein. Employ the services of an independent Commissioning Firm. The 
Commissioning Firm must be a 1st tier subcontractor of the General or Prime Contractor and must be financially 
and corporately independent of all other subcontractors.  The Commissioning Firm must employ a Lead Commissioning 
Specialist for the Contractor (CxC) that coordinates all aspects of the commissioning process. Perform Commissioning 
in accordance with the requirements of the contract specifications and the standard under which the Commissioning 
Firm's qualifications are approved. In the case of a conflict, the most stringent requirement will prevail.  <BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Commissioning Specialist for the Government (CxG) is a Government employee. In general, the CxC coordinates 
the commissioning activities and reports to the Contracting Officer's Representative/CxG, copying the General 
or Prime Contractor on all results in accordance with Third Party Certification (TPC) requirements. The CxC's 
responsibilities, along with all other contractors' commissioning responsibilities are detailed in the specifications.  
All members work together to fulfill their contracted responsibilities and meet the objectives of the Contract Documents.  <BRK/></TXT>

<BRK/>
Check with Government PM to determine the systems to be commissioned using this 
specification; some systems may be handled through alternate means.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Add other systems as appropriate for the facility to be commissioned.  Additional 
requirements may need to be added to the procedures specified herein.  Examples 
include elevator controls, fire suppression and alarm systems, security systems, 
audio/visual systems, and communications systems.<BRK/>

PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects or Air Force projects 
managed by the Army, a code of up to three characters within the submittal tags 
may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  
Codes for Army projects using the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" 
for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering Division or other 
organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident 
Office; and "PO" for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are 
not used for Navy, Air Force, and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Use the "S" classification only in SD-11 Closeout Submittals.  The "S" following 
a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability 
eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance 
with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.<BRK/>

Coordinate with the Government PM to determine if <BRK/>
designer attendance at Functional Performance Tests will be required.  For design-bid-build 
projects, the designer only attends if the AE contract requires designer to 
attend or if the in-house team will be funded to attend.  For design-build projects, 
this specification may require attendance by the designers, if necessary.  Edit 
the listing of team members as appropriate.<BRK/></NPR>
