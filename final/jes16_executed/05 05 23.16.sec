<NPR>NOTE:  AWS D1.1 requires 100% visual inspection of all welds.  The requirement 
to utilize a Certified Welding Inspector to perform visual inspection is included 
in the specification as AWS does not require this inspection be performed by 
a Certified Welding Inspector.  AWS D1.1 does not require NDT for any welds. 
The engineer or specification writer must specify what welds require NDT in 
addition to visual.  The methods of nondestructive testing required must be 
determined and specified by the designer.  Determine the type of nondestructive 
testing (NDT) method to be used, considering joint design, material thickness, 
and accessibility to the joint.  UT and RT are volumetric testing methods applicable 
to CJP groove welds.  PT and MT are nonvolumetric testing methods applicable 
for PJP and Fillet welds.  Determine joints critical to the structure which 
should be subjected to additional NDT.  Clearly indicate in the specifications 
or on the drawings which welded joints require 100 percent NDT, which joints 
require random inspection, and which NDT method(s) are to be used for each joint.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The percentage of joints tested should be randomized throughout the structure 
unless specific locations require NDT as determined by the engineer of record.  
Joints not inspected by magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, or ultrasonic or 
radiographic methods are subject to visual inspections only.  If quality control 
is to be primarily the Contractor's responsibility and the inspection and tests

required.</NPR><BRK/>

welds.  Document this inspection in the Visual <SUB>Weld Inspection Log</SUB>.  Test [50][_____] percent of CJP welds using 
ultrasonic testing per Table [6.2] [or 6.3] of <RID>AWS D1.1/D1.1M</RID>. Randomly test [50][_____] percent of all PJP and 
fillet welds or as indicated by magnetic particle or dye penetrant testing.  Verify the welds conform to paragraph

materials or workmanship do not conform to the specification requirements, the Government reserves the right 
to reject material or workmanship or both at any time before final acceptance of the structure containing the 
weldment.  Any indication of a defect is regarded as a defect, unless re-evaluation by nondestructive methods

<TXT>If inspection or testing indicates defects in the weld joints, repair defective welds using a qualified welder

Repair defects discovered between passes before additional weld material is deposited.  Wherever a defect is 
removed and repair by welding is not required, blend the affected area into the surrounding surface to eliminate 
sharp notches, crevices, or corners.  After a defect is thought to have been removed, and before re-welding, 
examine the area by suitable methods to ensure that the defect has been eliminated.  Repaired welds must meet 
the inspection requirements for the original welds.</TXT><BRK/>
