<NPR>NOTE:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Designer must edit this specification section for either a performance-designed 
system or a fully designed system as applicable.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
This section is primarily intended for performance designed systems, e.g. systems 
where the size, layout, and support of branch lines and cross mains, and the 
layout of sprinklers will be designed by the Contractor.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
This section is not intended to be used for NFPA 13D systems.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Designer must provide the following information in the contract documents 
for performance designed systems.  This information must be in accordance with 
UFC 3-600-01.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(1) Show the layout and size of all piping and equipment from the point of connection 
to the water supply, to the sprinkler riser.  The contract drawings must include 
a detailed sprinkler riser diagram.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(2) Show location and size of service laterals, sprinkler risers, control valves, 
drain lines, sectional valves, and inspector's test valves and switches on the drawings.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(3) Specify waterflow data including hydrant flow test results, including the 
location where the hydrant flow test was conducted, the location and size of 
existing mains and new water supply lines that will serve the sprinkler system.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(4) Highlight or clearly indicate the area(s) to be protected by sprinklers 
on the drawings.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(5) Specify waterflow requirements including the design density, design area, 
the hose stream demand (including location of the hose stream demand), the duration 
of supply, and sprinkler spacing and area of coverage in this section.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(6) Show the location of the backflow preventer (including provisions for a 
drain and access for maintenance) on the drawings.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(7) Show all provisions necessary for forward flow testing of the backflow preventer 
at system demand as required by NFPA 13 on the drawings.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(8) Highlight all concealed spaces on the drawings that require sprinkler protection, 
such as spaces above suspended ceilings that are built of combustible material 
or that can contain combustible materials, such as storage, and communication 
cabling that is not fire-rated.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(9) Provide details on the drawings of pipe restraints for underground piping.  
This includes details of pipe clamps, tie rods, mechanical retainer glands, 
and thrust blocks.<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Residential Occupancies:  NFPA 13R is applicable for residential occupancies 
up to and including four stories in height.  This standard should be referenced 
and followed only for such occupancies.  NFPA 13R differs from NFPA 13 relative 
to type of sprinkler, design criteria, sprinkler coverage, and other requirements; 
therefore, care must be taken when using this specification for residential 
occupancies to assure that the final project specification clearly indicates 
design requirements.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G".  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.<BRK/>

<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation
