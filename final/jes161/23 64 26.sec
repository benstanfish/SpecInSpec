PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.</NPR><BRK/>

shall be interpreted to mean the "Contracting Officer."  For Navy owned property, references to the "owner" shall

<SPT><TTL>Administrative Interpretations</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>For ICC Codes referenced in the contract documents, the provisions of Chapter 1, "Administrator," do not apply.  
These administrative requirements are covered by the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) included 
in this contract and by the authority granted to the Officer in Charge of Construction to administer the construction 
of this project.  References in the ICC Codes to sections of Chapter 1, shall be applied appropriately by the 
Contracting Officer as authorized by his administrative cognizance and the FAR.</TXT><BRK/>

</SPT><SPT><TTL>SAFETY REQUIREMENTS</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Exposed moving parts, parts that produce high operating temperature, parts which may be electrically energized,

with other types of safety devices.  Safety devices shall be installed so that proper operation of equipment 
is not impaired.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Protect stored items from the weather, humidity and temperature variations, dirt and dust, or other contaminants.  
Proper protection and care of all material both before and during installation shall be the Contractor's responsibility.  
Any materials found to be damaged shall be replaced at the Contractor's expense.  During installation, cap piping 
and similar openings to keep out dirt and other foreign matter.  Any porous materials found to be contaminated 
with mold or mildew will be replaced at the Contractor's expense.  Non-porous materials found to be contaminated 
with mold or mildew will be disinfected and cleaned prior to installation.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Drawings</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Because of the small scale of the drawings, it is not possible to indicate all offsets, fittings, and accessories

<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The following requirement is intended to solicit the installer's help 
in the prudent location of equipment when he has some control over locations.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
However, designer's should not rely on it at all since enforcing this requirement 
in the field would be difficult.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Therefore, the system designer needs to layout and indicate the locations of 
equipment, control devices, and access doors so that most of the accessibility 
questions are resolved inexpensively during design.</NPR><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>Install all work so that parts requiring periodic inspection, operation, maintenance, and repair are readily 
accessible.  Install concealed valves, expansion joints, controls, dampers, and equipment requiring access, in 
locations freely accessible through access doors.</TXT><BRK/>
