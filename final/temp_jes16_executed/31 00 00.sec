Unit-price items are multiplied by the approximated and stated quantity giving a sum that is then added to the 
price for the rest of the work.  The result is a lump sum bid with automatic provision for payment or credit due 
to variations in earthwork within 15 percent of that shown and bid upon.  Variations exceeding 15 percent of that 
shown and bid upon will become the subject of negotiations in accordance with FAR 52.211-18 Variation in Estimated

<NPR>NOTE:  It is important to specify select material under footings and slabs to minimize settlement and to ensure 
stability of a structure.  Consideration should be made of the sensitivity of the structure to total and/or differential 
settlements related to the structural design.  This is particularly true of add-on structures and structures to 
be founded partly on fill and partly on natural ground.  For crib retaining wall, not more than 10 percent by 
weight of the fill material should be finer than<MET> 75 micrometers</MET><ENG> No. 200</ENG> sieve.  Also, specify coefficient of permeability 
within the range of<MET> 0.01 to 1.0 mm per second</MET><ENG> 0.002 to 0.20 feet per minute</ENG> and soil classification GW, GP, SW 
and SP.  Indicate with cross sections or section details on the contract drawings the limits or extents of any 
controlled fills or backfills.  Specify class of material that is acceptable in the fill or backfill giving preference 
to any types available at or near the site.  Select appropriate values for Atterberg limits and percentage of 
fines and specify maximum thickness of lifts for compaction.</NPR><BRK />

<NPR>d.  The exception to required high degree of compaction in fills and backfills is in expansive soils (see UFC 
3-220-01).  Where it is necessary to use materials having swelling characteristics, usually CL or CH classifications, 
the specified degree of compaction will be related to laboratory test results for swelling under a considerable 
range of molding moisture and compactive effort.  In swelling soils, it is important to specify a density and 
molding moisture range that will enable the soil to stay stable, striking a reasonable balance between potential 
swell and excessive settlement under load, even at the expense of accepting a reduced bearing capacity.  A maximum 
permissible density should be established to minimize swelling. If possible, soils with swelling characteristics 
will be classified as unsatisfactory material, particularly under critical stability structures.</NPR><BRK />
