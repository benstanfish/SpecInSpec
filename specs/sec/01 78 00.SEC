by, but not limited to: contract modifications; official responses to submitted Requests for Information (RFI's); 
direction from the Contracting Officer; design that is the responsibility of the Contractor, and differing site 
conditions.  Maintain the as-builts throughout construction as red-lined hard copies on site and/or red-lined

<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>
