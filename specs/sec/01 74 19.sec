</SPT><SPT><TTL>GOVERNMENT POLICY</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Government policy is to apply sound environmental principles in the design, construction and use of facilities.  
As part of the implementation of that policy, practice efficient waste management when sizing, cutting, and installing 
products and materials, and use all reasonable means to divert construction and demolition waste from landfills 
and incinerators and to facilitate their recycling or reuse.  Divert a minimum of 60 percent by weight of total 
project solid waste from the landfill.[Comply with TPC requirements as specified in Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY 
REQUIREMENTS AND REPORTING.]</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>MANAGEMENT</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Develop and implement a waste management program.  Take a pro-active, responsible role in the management of construction 
and demolition waste and require all subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers to participate in the effort.  The 
Environmental Manager, as specified in Section [<SRF>01 57 19</SRF>][<SRF>01 57 19.01</SRF>] TEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS, is responsible 
for instructing workers and overseeing and documenting results of the Waste Management Plan for the project.  
Construction and demolition waste includes products of demolition or removal, excess or unusable construction 
materials, packaging materials for construction products, and other materials generated during the construction 
process but not incorporated into the work.  In the management of waste, consider the availability of viable 
markets, the condition of the material, the ability to provide the material in suitable condition and in a  quantity 
acceptable to available markets, and time constraints imposed by internal project completion mandates.  Implement 
any special programs involving rebates or similar incentives related to recycling of waste.  Revenues or other 
savings obtained for salvage, or recyclable materials not claimed by the Government will accrue to the Contractor.  
Appropriately permit firms and facilities used for recycling, reuse, and disposal for the intended use to the 
extent required by federal, state, and local regulations.  Also, provide on-site instruction of appropriate separation, 
handling, recycling, salvage, reuse, and return methods to be used by all parties at the appropriate stages of 
the project.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>Control accumulation of waste materials and trash.  Where materials are to be turned over to the Contractor for 
disposal, every effort shall be made to obtain credit from the disposal to reduce the cost of the Contract. Recycle 
or dispose of collected materials off of Government property at intervals approved by the Contracting Officer 
and in compliance with waste management procedures of <RID>JEGS</RID> and local laws and regulations.[For MCAS Iwakuni, 
metal Items to be demolished shall be sent to the Recycle Center, Building 7725.]  Except as otherwise specified 
in other sections of the specifications, dispose of in accordance with the following:</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">1.  Reuse.  Give first consideration to salvage for reuse since little or no re-processing is necessary 
for this method, and less pollution is created when items are reused in their original form.  Consider 
sale or donation of waste suitable for reuse.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">2.  Recycle.  Recycle waste materials not suitable for reuse, but having value as being recyclable.  
Recycle all fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, and mercury-containing thermostats removed from the site.  
Arrange for timely pickups from the site or deliveries to recycling facilities in order to prevent contamination 
of recyclable materials.</LST><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33">3.  Compost.  Consider composting on-site if a reasonable amount of compostable material will be available.  
Compostable materials include plant material, sawdust, and certain food scraps.</LST><BRK/>

where available.  As the last choice, dispose of materials at a landfill or incinerator.</LST><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33">5.  Return.  Set aside and protect misdelivered and substandard products and materials and return to 
supplier for credit.</LST><BRK/>
