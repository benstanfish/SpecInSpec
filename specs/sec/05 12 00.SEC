<NPR>NOTE:  Indicate the location of test welds and types of testing desired.  The

small surface defects by enhancing the visibility of the flaw.  Magnetic particle 
testing detects surface cracks and near-surface cracks; this test provides more

Ultrasonic testing detect surface and internal cracks, delaminations, lack of 
fusion, and density and thickness variations.  Generally, fillet welds can only 
be dye penetrant or magnetic particle tested.  All complete penetration welds 
should be ultrasonically tested.  See AWS D1.1/D1.1M for other methods of NDT
