list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G".  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.   Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in 
context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes following the "G" typically 
are not used for Navy,  Air Force, and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>

materials before using application equipment for mixing and transporting materials.  Do not permit equipment on the project site that has residue 
of materials used on previous projects.  Use cleaners only for cleaning, not for thinning primers or membrane materials.  Ensure that workers and 
others who walk on cured membrane wear clean, soft-soled shoes to avoid damaging the waterproofing materials.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>APPLICATION</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Over primed surfaces, provide a uniform, wet, monolithic coating of fluid-applied membrane,<MET> 1.5 mm</MET><ENG> 60 mils</ENG> thick, plus or minus<MET> 0.125 mm</MET><ENG> 5 mils</ENG>
 by following manufacturer's printed instructions.  Apply material by trowel, squeegee, roller, brush, spray apparatus, or other method recommended 
by membrane manufacturer.  Check wet film thickness as specified in paragraph entitled "Film Thickness" and adjust application rate as necessary 
to provide a uniform coating of the thickness specified.  Where possible, mark off surface to be coated in equal units to facilitate proper coverage.  
At expansion joints, control joints, prepared cracks, flashing, and terminations, carry membrane over preformed elastomeric sheet in a uniform<MET> 
1.5 mm</MET><ENG> 60 mil</ENG> thick, plus or minus<MET> 0.125 mm</MET><ENG> 5 mils</ENG>, wet thickness to provide a monolithic coating.  If membrane cures before next application, 
wipe previously applied membrane with a solvent to remove dirt and dust that could inhibit adhesion of overlapping membrane coat.  Use solvent 
recommended by the membrane manufacturer, as approved.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Work Sequence</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Perform work so that protection board is installed prior to using the waterproofed surface.  Do not permanently install protection board until 
the membrane has passed the flood test specified under paragraph entitled "Flood Test."  Move material storage areas as work progresses to prevent 
abuse of membrane and overloading of structural deck.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Protection Board</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Protect fluid-applied membrane by placing protection board over membrane at a time recommended by the membrane manufacturer.  Protect membrane 
application when protection board is not placed immediately.  Butt protection boards together and do not overlap.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Drainage Course</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Place drainage course where shown after flood tests are completed and concrete protection slab or wearing course is ready to be installed.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Insulation</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Place insulation of thickness indicated, on top of drainage course just prior to placement of concrete protection slab.</TXT><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>After application and curing is complete, plug drains and fill waterproofed area with water to a depth of<MET> 50 mm</MET><ENG> 2 inches</ENG>.  A minimum 48 hour cure 
time, or longer cure time if recommended by the membrane manufacturer, shall be required prior to flood testing.  Allow water to stand 24 hours.  <TST>
Test watertightness by measuring water level at beginning and end of the 24 hour period.  If water level falls, drain water, allow installation 
to dry, and inspect.</TST>  Make repairs or replace as required and repeat the test.  Work shall not proceed before approval of repairs or replacement.</TXT><BRK/>

of vapor retarder; date of completion; installing contractor identification and contract information; membrane manufacturer warranty expiration, 
warranty reference number, and contact information.  Install card at roof top or access location as directed by the Contracting Officer and provide
