<NPR>NOTE:  AWS D1.1 requires 100% visual inspection of all welds.  The requirement 
to utilize a Certified Welding Inspector to perform visual inspection is included 
in the specification as AWS does not require this inspection be performed by 
a Certified Welding Inspector.  AWS D1.1 does not require NDT for any welds. 
The engineer or specification writer must specify what welds require NDT in 
addition to visual.  The methods of nondestructive testing required must be 
determined and specified by the designer.  Determine the type of nondestructive 
testing (NDT) method to be used, considering joint design, material thickness, 
and accessibility to the joint.  UT and RT are volumetric testing methods applicable 
to CJP groove welds.  PT and MT are nonvolumetric testing methods applicable 
for PJP and Fillet welds.  Determine joints critical to the structure which 
should be subjected to additional NDT.  Clearly indicate in the specifications 
or on the drawings which welded joints require 100 percent NDT, which joints 
require random inspection, and which NDT method(s) are to be used for each joint.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The percentage of joints tested should be randomized throughout the structure 
unless specific locations require NDT as determined by the engineer of record.  
Joints not inspected by magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, or ultrasonic or 
radiographic methods are subject to visual inspections only.  If quality control 
is to be primarily the Contractor's responsibility and the inspection and tests 
are adequately called out, then acceptance by the Government can rely on the 
Contractor's work and records -- with some spot checking to verify the results.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If the Contractor must perform nondestructive inspection other than visual, 
or inspection other than that covered by Section 6 of AWS D1.1/D1.1M, add these 
requirements to this paragraph.  Clearly show the extent of inspection either 
on the drawings or by this or other sections of the specifications.  Edit the 
bracketed portion of the paragraph to define the extent of nondestructive testing 
required.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>All welded connections per AWS D1.1 will be tested to the static acceptance 
criteria by default.  Connections that require testing to cyclic criteria must 
be specified by the engineer of record.</NPR><BRK/>

welds.  Document this inspection in the Visual <SUB>Weld Inspection Log</SUB>.  Test [50][_____] percent of CJP welds using 
ultrasonic testing per Table [6.2] [or 6.3] of <RID>AWS D1.1/D1.1M</RID>. Randomly test [50][_____] percent of all PJP and

Repair defects discovered between passes before additional weld material is deposited.  Wherever a defect is 
removed and repair by welding is not required, blend the affected area into the surrounding surface to eliminate 
sharp notches, crevices, or corners.  After a defect is thought to have been removed, and before re-welding, 
examine the area by suitable methods to ensure that the defect has been eliminated.  Repaired welds must meet 
the inspection requirements for the original welds.</TXT><BRK/>
