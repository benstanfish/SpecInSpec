test on newly installed cables. Maximum applied DC test voltage shall be determined in consultation with the manufacturer of the 
cable and cable accessories for the type of cable being tested. The maximum test voltage to be maintained for 10 minutes. After 
reaching the maximum test voltage, the current magnitude should be recorded at least twice: once at approximately 2 min and again 
at the end of the test period (10 min) Contractor shall submit test procedure and standard use as reference for testing to the
