be provided at the locations indicated.  Submit exterior signage schedule in electronic media with spread sheet 
format.  Spread sheet must include sign location, sign type, and message.  Signs must be complete with lettering, 
framing as detailed, and related components for a complete installation.  Each sample must consist of a complete 
sign panel with letters and symbols.  Samples may be installed in the work, provided each sample is identified 
and location recorded.  Submit [three] [_____] color samples for each material requiring color and<MET> 300 mm</MET><ENG> 12

<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a ìGî to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose 
the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>

are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.

Editing of color reference sentence(s) must be coordinated with the Government.

is designed by an Architect or Interior designer.  Color must be selected from

Coordinate choice of colors with manufacturer's information as regards to color 
fastness. Coordinate color selections with installation standards, if one exists.<BRK/>

When the Government directs that color be located in the drawings a note must 
be added that states:  "Where color is shown as being specific to one manufacturer, 
an equivalent color by another manufacturer may be submitted for approval.   
Manufacturers and materials specified are not intended to limit the selection

Prior to specifying a custom color finish, research to determine if additional 
cost and lead time is feasible.  Note there is often a minimum order requirement; 
this requirement will also affect future orders.<BRK/>
