<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification covers the requirements for <SCP>potable and non-potable (i.e., raw water, sea, salt 
water) systems</SCP>, in which the largest size pipe is<MET> 1200 mm</MET><ENG> 60 inches</ENG> in diameter and the maximum system working 
pressure is<MET> 1000 kPa</MET><ENG> 150 psi</ENG>.  This maximum working pressure depends on piping materials and appurtenances listed 
in this specification.  Ensure that the pressure class of piping materials and appurtenances exceeds the maximum 
working pressure of the system.  This section covers water systems for use outside of buildings, including water 
mains, water transmission mains and water service lines to a point approximately<MET> 1.5 m</MET><ENG> 5 feet</ENG> from the perimeter 
of buildings or structures..  Water lines within<MET> 1.5 m</MET><ENG> 5 feet</ENG> of the building are typically covered by Division

<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy and Air Force projects.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Effective January 2014, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requirements for "lead free" were updated.  
The amended definition of "lead free*" is 0.20 percent max lead for solder and flux; 0.25 percent max lead for 
products by weighted average; Multiple component products are calculated to address total wetted exposure based 
upon wetted surface area of each component and that component's lead content by percentage </NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NSF/ANSI 61 was revised in 2008 to establish Annex G for requirements when a 0.25 percent lead content requirement 
needed to be met since some states (California, Vermont, Maryland, and Louisiana) incorporated these requirements

glands) may be subject to <HL2>permeation</HL2> by lower molecular weight organic solvents or petroleum products.  If a water 
pipe must pass through such a contaminated area or an area subject to contamination, consult with the manufacturer 
regarding permeation of pipe walls, jointing materials, and so forth, <HL2>before</HL2> selecting materials for use in that
