evaluate past safety performance of potential subcontractors in the selection process. Also, describe innovative 
methods used to ensure and monitor safe work practices of subcontractors. The Government considers the Prime 
Contractor to be the "controlling employer" for all worksite safety and health of the subcontractors.  Contractors 
are responsible for informing their subcontractors of the safety provisions under the terms of the Contract and 
the penalties for noncompliance, coordinating the work to prevent one craft from interfering with or creating 
hazardous working conditions for other crafts, and inspecting subcontractor operations to ensure that accident 
prevention responsibilities are being carried out. The APP must be signed in accordance with ENG Form 6293 Accident 
Prevention Plan Worksheet. The SSHO must provide and maintain the APP and a log of signatures by each subcontractor 
foreman, attesting that they have read and understand the APP, and make the APP and log available on-site to

that includes, as a minimum, electrical hard hat, safety footwear, insulating gloves and electrical arc flash 
protection for personnel as required by <RID>NFPA 70E</RID>.  Insulating blankets, hearing protection, and switching suits 
may also be required, depending on the specific job and as delineated in the Contractor's AHA.  Ensure that each 
employee is familiar with and complies with these procedures and <RID>29 CFR 1910</RID>and <RID>29 CFR 1926</RID>.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Energized Electrical Work Permit (EEWP)</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>All equipment and circuits must be placed into an Establishing an Electrically Safe Working Condition (ESWC) 
must be de-energized before work is started unless energized work can be justified.  A QP must complete and verify 
the following to establish electrically safe working condition in accordance with <RID>EM 385-1-1</RID>, paragraph 11-8.d 
unless the work meets the EEWP exemption located under <RID>EM 385-1-1</RID>, paragraph 11-8.e(5) or the host employer or 
system owner can show that there are additional hazards or an increased risk from de-energizing.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Hazardous Energy:  Any energy including but not limited to mechanical (for example, power transmission apparatus, 
counterbalances, springs, pressure, gravity), pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical, stored electrical energy exists 
such as Uninterrupted Power Systems (UPS), chemical, nuclear, and thermal (for example, high or low temperature) 
energies, which could cause injury to employees.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Once it has been determined that equipment must be worked on in an energized condition, an EEWP must be submitted 
to the USACE supervisor/KO or COR and AHJ for acceptance.  Do not perform energized work without prior authorization.  
All permits must be prepared, signed, and authorized in advance of performing any electrical work.  A non-mandatory 
ENG Form 6277 (Energized Electrical Work Permit) is provided in <RID>EM 385-1-1</RID>, Chapter 11-10.</TXT><BRK/>

</SPT><SPT><TTL>Qualifications</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Electrical work must be performed by QP with verifiable credentials who are familiar with applicable code requirements.  
Verifiable credentials consist of State, National and Local <SUB>Certifications</SUB> or <SUB>Licenses</SUB> that a Master or Journeyman 
Electrician may hold, depending on work being performed, and must be identified in the appropriate AHA.  Journeyman/Apprentice 
ratio must be in accordance with Host Nation requirements applicable to where work is being performed.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Arc Flash</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Conduct a hazard analysis/arc flash hazard analysis whenever work on or near energized parts greater than 50 
volts is necessary, in accordance with <RID>NFPA 70E</RID>.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>All personnel entering the identified arc flash protection boundary must be QPs and properly trained in <RID>NFPA 70E</RID>
 requirements and procedures.  Unless permitted by <RID>NFPA 70E</RID>, no Unqualified Person is permitted to approach nearer 
than the Limited Approach Boundary of energized conductors and circuit parts.  Training must be administered 
by an electrically qualified source and documented.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Grounding</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Ground electrical circuits, equipment and enclosures in accordance with <RID>NFPA 70</RID> and <RID>IEEE C2</RID> to provide a permanent, 
continuous and effective path to ground unless otherwise noted by <RID>EM 385-1-1</RID>.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Testing</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Temporary electrical distribution systems and devices must be inspected, tested and found acceptable for Ground-Fault 
Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) protection, polarity, ground continuity, and ground resistance before <NED/>initial use, 
before use after modification and at least monthly.  Monthly inspections and tests must be maintained for each 
temporary electrical distribution system, and signed by the electrical CP or QP.</TXT><BRK/>
