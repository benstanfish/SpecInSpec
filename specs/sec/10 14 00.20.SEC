<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This section covers some of the more common interior sign types.  When 
other sign types are to be used, such as elevator-related signs, occupancy load 
signs and structural load limit signs, specifications will be modified accordingly.  
Buildings will be accessible in accordance with 36 CFR, Part 1191, Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities 
except for Army buildings excluded by TI 800-01 Design Criteria.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Reference UFC 3-120-01 available at  Unified Federal Criteria Design: Sign Standard 
for design, construction and placement of signs.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>In combination with this specification, drawings and attachments will include 
location, dimensions, elevations, schedules, content, details and such other 
information as required to indicate the extent of the work.  The same terminology 
and designations used in the specification will be used on the drawings, schedules 
and attachments.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Product selections must be based on quality, aesthetic values, appearance, and 
cost as related to project needs.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Use of personal names on interior signage is discouraged.  If personal names 
are required, changeable message strips will be used.  Consider coordination 
of interior signage within this specification with signage required on individual 
workstations which is specified in Section <SRF>12 59 00</SRF> SYSTEMS FURNITURE.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Interior stairwell signage will be provided in accordance with Life Safety Code 
NFPA 101, Chapter 5, and applicable occupancy chapters.  Clearly define interstitial 
spaces or other doorways within stairwell that do not lead to a horizontal exitway 
with signage that states "Not an Exit".</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Permanent information on room identification signs includes the room number 
on all room identification signs, symbol and message on toilet rooms, message 
on janitor closets, mechanical/electrical and communications rooms, and message 
on stairs.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Where appropriate for MEDICAL FACILITIES, include the following requirements 
for signage:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
1.  Room numbering for spaces within the medical facility will be determined 
jointly by the using facility and the design team.  User room number will be 
different than architectural room number (see UFC 4-510-01 Design:  Medical 
Military Facilities).  Room numbering will be consistent throughout the facility.  
For inpatient medical facilities, rooms with audiovisual nurse call must have 
a unique user room number, since audiovisual nurse call is tied into a digital 
paging system.  For outpatient clinics, rooms with tonevisual nurse call, do 
not need a unique user room number, since tonevisual nurse call is hardwired 
to a panel located at a nursing station.  Room numbering should address the 
following issues:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
    a.  Wayfinding within clinics and other departments (user room #).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
    b.  Facility Maintenance (architectural room #).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
    c.  Audiovisual Nurse Call (inpatient) (unique user room #).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
    d.  Tonevisual Nurse Call (outpatient) (user room #).<BRK/>
<BRK/>
2.  The use of symbols/graphics on interior signage will be limited.  International 
symbols and graphics will be used where needed.  Recommended symbols include 
men/women symbol for toilet rooms and showers, men/women symbol with key for 
locker rooms, telephone symbol for public telephone areas, information (?), 
radiation symbol, biohazard symbol, and handicap symbol.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
3.  Arrow placement order on interior signage will comply with UFC 4-510-01 
Design:  Medical Military Facilities.  Left pointing arrows at top of sign, 
followed by up pointing arrows, then right pointing arrows at bottom of sign.  
Example follows:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
            &lt; EMERGENCY<BRK/>
            ^ Orthopedic Clinic<BRK/>
            &gt; Admissions<BRK/>
<BRK/>
4.  Signage schedule should be provided in electronic spreadsheet format.  Schedule 
will include architectural room number, user room number, type of sign, message, 
symbol (if needed), color, and mounting location.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
5.  Building directories and accompanying orientation maps for the medical facility 
will be determined jointly by the using facility and the design team.  Orientation 
maps, if required, will be included as part of the interior signage package, 
and should be of the same manufacturer.  Include international symbols for information 
(?), parking areas (upper case P within circle), public toilet rooms, public 
telephones, and graphic north arrow on orientation maps.  Orientation map is 
to be positioned so that building left is viewer's left.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
6.  Large, easy to read signs over reception counters, check-in counters, information 
desks, or departments will be provided.  Signs should be either ceiling mounted 
or affixed to soffit directly above counters.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
7.  Room identification signs should be<MET> 200 mm x 200 mm</MET><ENG> 8 x 8 inch</ENG> or<MET> 230 mm 
x 230 mm</MET><ENG> 9 x 9 inch</ENG>.  Justification of room number and message will be flush left.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
8.  Fire evacuation signs will be provided in accordance with the local Fire 
Marshal, if required.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
9.  Overhead directional signs should not block fire exit signs.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
10.  Signage will clearly define all staff, public, or patient toilet rooms.</NPR><BRK/>

PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a ìGî to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>
