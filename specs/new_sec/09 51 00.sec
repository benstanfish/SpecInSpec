<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>Note:  Plaster or gypsum wallboard ceilings, metal faced or ceramic-bonded mineral 
fiber acoustical ceilings should be used in lieu of mineral fiber, or fiberglass 
base acoustical ceiling systems, in wet areas such as showers and bathrooms 
or around grills, in kitchens, and similar facilities where greasy vapors are 
a problem.  Be alert to this fact, however, gypsum board made in other countries 
may contain asbestos which, of course, is unacceptable.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Drawings should indicate the following:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>a.  Location of acoustical systems.  Arrangement of acoustical units, panels, 
light fixtures, and diffusers, other penetrations and exposed suspension grids.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>b.  Location of systems required to have ceiling attenuation class (CAC).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>c.  Location of continuous or common acoustical ceilings that span or cover 
more than one room, so adequate detailing can be addressed on the drawings to 
coordinate requirements between CAC and STC ratings.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>d.  Location and details of system required to have a fire resistive rating.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>e.  Location and details and material of fire stops above suspended ceilings.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>f.  Location and details of access panels and maximum spacing of suspension 
members for concealed grid suspension systems.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>g.  Location of each different color and pattern when more than one type acoustical 
unit is specified for a project.  Details of special or patterned panels if 
necessary to describe adequately.  If more than one system is used, key to locations 
by using symbols.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>h.  Where acoustical ceilings are provided in conjunction with thermal insulation 
beneath vented attic spaces, careful attention should be given to furnishing 
the appropriate type ceiling tile, adequate details on the contract drawings, 
and to including appropriate sections in the specifications.  Details on the 
drawings will cover such features as support of insulation at flush-mounted 
light fixtures, conduit, acoustical units, suspension system components, heating 
and air-conditioning units, and other utilities.  Installation of insulation 
over the suspension systems, light fixtures, and other ceiling penetrations 
will be coordinated with Sections <SRF>06 10 00</SRF> ROUGH CARPENTRY and <SRF>07 21 13</SRF> BOARD 
AND BLOCK INSULATION, and manufacturer's literature.</NPR><BRK/>

PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
 The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  When reflected ceiling plans showing ceiling penetrations are included 
in the project drawings, it may not be necessary for the Contractor to re-draw 
and submit as a shop drawing; in such cases, delete the requirement from SD-02.  
Details not applicable to the project should also be deleted.  On simple projects 
where manufacturer's standard printed data are sufficient, omit this submittal 
category from SD-03.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Where many different ceiling systems are used, it may be more convenient to 
schedule STC ratings, fire ratings, panel and suspension types on the drawings, 
keyed to finish schedules, rather than to include this data in the specification.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Provide sound controlling units mechanically mounted on a ceiling suspension system for acoustical treatment.  
The unit size, texture, finish, and color must be as specified.  Coordinate the whole ceiling system with other 
details, like the location of access panels and ceiling penetrations, etc., shown on the drawings.  The Contractor 
is responsible for all associated labor and materials and for the final assembly and performance of the specified 
work and products are used.  The location and extent of acoustical treatment must be as shown on the <SUB>approved 
detail drawings</SUB>.  Submit drawings showing suspension system, method of anchoring and fastening, details, and 
reflected ceiling plan.  Coordinate with paragraph RECLAMATION PROCEDURES for reclamation of mineral fiber acoustical 
ceiling panels to be removed from the job site.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Fire Resistive Ceilings</TTL><NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Certified laboratory test reports for fire resistance rating and ceiling 
attenuation class (CAC) cannot be obtained for ceiling assemblies which are 
nonstandard with the manufacturer.  Therefore, where a fire resistance rating 
and/or ceiling sound transmission class are necessary, do not specify a nonstandard 
ceiling assembly.  Refer to data in the UL Fire Resistance Directory for details.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For Navy projects, delete this paragraph when fire separation is not required 
by UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities.  Where required, 
rating applies to total floor-ceiling or roof-ceiling assembly, including mechanical-electrical 
elements, penetrations, structural system, and deck.  If system is required 
to be fire-endurance rated, show details of recessed fixture enclosures and 
other penetrations on drawings.</NPR><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>Rate acoustical ceiling systems, indicated as fire resistant, for fire endurance as specified when tested in 
accordance with <RID>ASTM E119</RID>.  Test suspended ceiling with a specimen [roof][floor] assembly representative of the 
indicated construction, including mechanical and electrical work within ceiling space openings for light fixtures, 
and air outlets, and access panels.  Provide ceiling assembly rating for [[1][1-1/2][2][3][4] hour [concealed 
grid system][exposed grid system]][as shown on drawings].  Provide acoustical units with a flame spread of 25

<SPT><TTL>Ceiling Attenuation Class and Test</TTL><NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Ensure that CAC rating chosen is coordinated with rating of walls detailed 
on the drawings.  It is inappropriate to have high CAC rating for ceilings if 
walls nullify acoustical benefit.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Where room partitions do not extend to floor or roof deck above, ceiling plenum 
path may prevent acoustical privacy between rooms.  Where required to provide 
adequate room to room sound attenuation, entire ceiling assembly, including 
air terminals and light fixtures, should have appropriate Ceiling Attenuation 
Class (CAC).  Any penetration of ceiling assembly will destroy integrity of 
ceiling in this regard.  Verify that other specification sections and drawings 
include appropriate data to ensure that these requirements are met for air terminals 
and light fixtures.  For standard applications, specify CAC range of 35 - 39.  
A ceiling CAC range of 40-44 is recommended for all spaces where speech privacy 
is required and that are surrounded or sub-divided by partitions which do not 
extend to underside of floor or roof deck above.  For classified conference 
rooms, executive offices, teleconferencing rooms and other occupancies requiring 
the highest degree of speech privacy, sound attenuation requirements will have 
to be achieved by other means, most likely by high sound transmission class 
(STC) partition extending to the underside of floor or roof deck above.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>Generally, lay-in panels supported by exposed grid suspension system provide 
most economical installation and allow greatest access to space above ceiling.  
Where lay-in panels are subject to displacement by building occupants or where 
ceiling must be directly attached to underside of structural system, concealed 
framing system may be more appropriate.  In lobbies, auditoriums, chapels or 
clubs where a monolithic appearance may be desired, greater expense of concealed 
suspension system may be justified.  Downward access concealed systems should 
not be specified in areas of high seismic activity.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>An intermediate-duty suspension system should be specified when the minimum 
load-carrying capacity of the main runner is<MET> 175 N per m</MET><ENG> 12 pounds per linear 
foot</ENG> on a simple span of<MET> 1200 mm</MET><ENG> 4 feet</ENG> without the mid-span deflection exceeding 
1/360th of the span.  Intermediate-duty systems are used primarily for ordinary 
commercial structures where some ceiling loads, due to light fixtures and air 
diffusers are anticipated.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>A heavy-duty suspension system should be specified when the above described 
minimum load-carrying capacity is<MET> 230 N per m</MET><ENG> 16 pounds per linear foot</ENG>.  Heavy-duty 
systems are used when ceiling loads are greater than ordinary commercial construction.
