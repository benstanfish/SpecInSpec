<NPR>NOTE:  Review Submittal Description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G".  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.   Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in 
context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy,  Air Force, and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose the second bracketed item for 
Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>
