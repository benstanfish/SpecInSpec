<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
  The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook 
to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose the second bracketed item for 
Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Ceramic tile with low absorption rates are easier to maintain because they are more resistant to staining.  
They do not readily absorb grease, food or beverage spills, or other staining agents.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Not all tiles with a wet dynamic coefficient of friction (DCOF) AcuTest value equal to or greater than 0.42 are 
suitable for all level interior spaces.  Select tiles that are appropriate for specific project conditions, considering 
by way of example, but not in limitation, type of use, traffic, drainage, how the tiles are profiled or structured, 
expected contaminants, expected maintenance, expected wear, and manufacturers’ guidelines and recommendations.  
Tiles with a wet DCOF of less than 0.42, should only be installed when the surface will be kept dry when walked 
upon and proper safety procedures will be followed when cleaning the tiles.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Per TCNA breaking strength is measured in "lbf".  This specification uses "pounds" since this is how most manufacturers 
list the method of measurement.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Take into account expected foot traffic, building and site conditions and maintenance during selection of tile. 
In accordance with ANSI 137.1 the visible abrasion classifications for floors are as follows:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Class 0 - Generally used on walls. Not recommended for use on floors.  This type of tile should not be exposed 
to wear, traffic or aggressive maintenance.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Class I - Light Residential. Tile may withstand soft-soled foot traffic as long as dirt and/or other abrasives 
are not present. Tile should not be used in areas with direct access to the outside or in areas with large amounts 
of foot traffic.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Class II - Residential.  Tile may withstand soft-soled and some normal traffic with limited quantities of dirt 
and/or other abrasives.  Tile is not recommended in areas with direct access to the outside or in areas with large 
amounts of foot traffic. </NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Class III - Heavy Residential or Light Commercial.  Tile may withstand normal footwear and regular traffic with 
some dirt and/or other abrasives in limited quantities.  Tile may be used in light commercial facilities with 
limited foot traffic and no direct access to the outside.  Examples:  residential kitchens and hallways with limited 
outside traffic.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Class IV - Commercial. Tile may withstand heavier amounts of traffic with more dirt and abrasives.  Examples:  
commercial kitchens and spaces with regular outside traffic.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Class V - Heavy Commercial.  Tiles may withstand constant foot traffic with larger amounts of dirt and/or other 
abrasives.  Examples:  airports, malls, and other commercial walkways subject to high volumes of foot traffic 
and constant traffic from the outside. </NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Manufacturers use the aesthetic classification to identify the variation of color, texture, and appearance within 
a particular line of tile.  Delete this requirement if not necessary to express design intent.  </NPR><BRK/>
