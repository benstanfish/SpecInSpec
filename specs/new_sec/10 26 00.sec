<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose 
the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation 
are for [Contractor Quality Control approval.] [information only.  When used, a designation following the "G" 
designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the Government.]  Submittals with an "S" 
are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.

<NPR>NOTE:  Editing of color reference sentence(s) must be coordinated with the Government.  
Generally Section <SRF>09 06 00</SRF> SCHEDULES FOR FINISHES or drawing is used when the 
project is designed by an Architect or Interior designer.  Color must be selected 
from manufacturers standard colors or identified as a manufacturers color in 
this specification only when the project is very simple and has minimal finishes.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
When the Government directs that color be located in the drawings a note must 
be added that states:  "Where color is shown as being specific to one manufacturer, 
an equivalent color by another manufacturer may be submitted for approval.  
Manufacturers and materials specified are not intended to limit the selection 
of equal colors from other manufacturers.  The word "color" as used herein includes 
surface color and pattern."<BRK/>

Prior to specifying a custom color finish, research to determine if additional 
cost and lead time is feasible.  Note there is often a minimum order requirement; 
this requirement will also affect future orders.<BRK/>
