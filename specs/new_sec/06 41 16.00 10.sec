<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Designer should require materials, products, and innovative construction 
methods and techniques which are environmentally sensitive, take advantage of 
recycling and conserve natural resources.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Executive Order No. 12873, dated 20 October 1993, requires that Federal Agencies 
use environmentally preferable products and services and implement cost-effective 
procurement preference programs favoring purchase of these products and services.  
"Environmentally preferable" products and services are those that have a lesser 
or reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared with competing 
products or services that serve the same purpose.  This comparison may consider 
raw materials, components, acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, 
distribution, reuse, operation, maintenance, or disposal of the product or service.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Factors to consider include, but are not limited to:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
   1)  Ease of repairability and high durability.  A lesser frequency of replacement 
reduces landfill (i.e., need for more natural resources and energy) costs.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
   2)  Manufacturer/fabricator programs in place that reduce energy required 
or re-cycle energy, water, by-products, or waste materials in production methods.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
   3) Low volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and off-gassing in the production, 
fabrication, assembly, and installation of materials and components.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Evaluation of the sustainable efforts of a manufacturer is subjective.  There 
are no current measurable aspects of a sustainable program for casework materials 
which easily qualifies or disqualifies a manufacturer or fabricator.  The submittal 
reviewer should use the information provided in the Department of Army ETL 1110-3-491 
in conjunction with a common sense approach in making the evaluation.</NPR><BRK/>

The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes following the "G" typically 
are not used for Navy, Air Force, and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  This specification relies heavily on standards developed by the Architectural 
Woodwork Institute (AWI), a national not-for-profit organization of manufacturers 
of architectural woodwork, suppliers to the industry, and design professionals 
to provide specifications which accurately describe and quantify minimum standards 
for architectural woodwork.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>AWI architectural woodwork quality standards for casework materials and fabrication 
lists three quality categories: premium, custom, and economy grade.  The specifier 
must judge the level of quality required for the specific end use conditions.  
The specifier should become familiar with the differences between custom and 
premium grade quality differences before editing this specification.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
To insure suitable durability and appearance it is recommended that either the 
custom or premium grade quality be selected.  Economy grade should only be considered 
where severe funding limitations dictate this lesser quality be specified.  
AWI Sections 400G and 400B indicate the differences between grades regarding 
acceptable materials for substrates and components, fabrication methods, joinery, 
tolerances, and other factors.</NPR><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>EDGE BANDING</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  PVC edge banding for cabinet door and drawer front edges is a standard, 
industry-wide approved and widely used alternative to using plastic laminate.  
Advantages include:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
1) A more flexible material for better adhesion to substrate and minimization 
of delamination problems often occurring with laminate edges.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
2) Solid color through the banding eliminates the contrasting dark line at door 
and drawer edges typically found when plastic laminate is used to finish the 
edges, especially with light and solid colored laminates.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
3) PVC is more durable and less brittle under impact than laminate.  Typical 
installation detail and product standard width allows the PVC edging to overlap 
the laminate edge on the front and back surfaces of the doors and drawers to 
protect and minimizes the chance of chipped door edges commonly seen with laminate 
edged installations.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The most common edge banding is<MET> 0.5 mm</MET><ENG> 0.020 inch</ENG> in thickness and<MET> 24 mm</MET><ENG> 15/16 
inch</ENG> wide.  This edge banding is available in almost all solid colors and many 
patterns and woodgrains to match all major laminate selections.  If matching 
is desired, recommend coordination and selection during casework design to insure availability.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Edge banding is also available in other thicknesses for more durability, however, 
color selection is very limited in these greater thicknesses.</NPR><BRK/>
