<NPR>RADON MITIGATION FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Consult the current EPA radon map and EPA documents for each state for 
additional information concerning radon zones.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For new construction in Zone 1 areas as defined on "EPA Map of Radon Zones", 
or when testing identifies radon concentrations equal to or greater than 4 pCi/L, 
passive radon mitigation systems should be incorporated into the original building 
design.  The design should include provisions to permit installation of exhaust 
fans, if necessary, after testing the building under occupied conditions.  Criteria 
for radon mitigation in new construction is specified in EPA 625-R-92-016, (1994, 
Third Printing with Addenda) and the current version of "Radon Mitigation Standards 
for Schools and Large Buildings."</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Materials (aggregate for capillary water barrier and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) 
pipe) currently in use for constructing new buildings, when properly arranged 
as indicated and specified in EPA 625-R-92-016, will provide a passive radon 
mitigation system.  A separate specification section on radon mitigation for 
new construction seems unnecessary considering the materials are addressed in 
Division 02 and Division 15 sections and the installation will be shown on the 
drawings.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  A simple, effective, efficient, and economical radon mitigation system 
is little more than a PVC vent pipe (one suction point) exhausted to the atmosphere 
without a fan (passive system).  For large areas requiring mitigation, the system 
could include several vent pipes connected to a single outlet with an appropriately 
sized in-line fan (active system).  Depending on the distances between suction 
points, several individual vent pipes with or without in-line fans may be more 
practical.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This guide specification provides criteria and material requirements for constructing 
radon mitigation systems, post mitigation testing and constructing gypsum wallboard 
enclosures to conceal the radon mitigation systems in occupied spaces.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The Designer should include unit price items to address post mitigation 
radon testing.  Estimate the quantity and specify as unit price items in Section 
00 21 13, INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS or Section <SRF>01 20 00</SRF> Price and Payment Procedures 
per standard practice of the activity preparing the contract.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The work may involve a historic property.  The designer must coordinate 
review of the proposed work with the appropriate cultural resources manager 
(CRM) and cultural resource laws and regulations, as part of the environmental 
review and permitting process.  Consultation with stakeholders, including the 
state historic preservation office, may be required, and work involving historic 
properties will likely be required to confirm to the Secretary of the Interior's 
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (usually at the REHABILITATION 
level).  See <URL>https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/four-treatments/treatment-<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  For work in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii select picoCuries
