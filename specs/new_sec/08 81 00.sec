<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal

the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.</NPR><BRK/>

TI 800-01, DESIGN CRITERIA. Tinted (light-reducing) glass may be used where glare is a problem and a reduction 
of visible light transmission is desired.  Visible light transmittance will vary from 15 to 85 percent, depending 
on color density and thickness.  Color density is a function of thickness and increases as the thickness increases; 
visible light transmittance will decrease as thickness increases.  ASTM C1036 separates Heat-Absorbing and Tinted 
(light-reducing) glasses into categories, Higher light transmittance, and Lower light transmittance, which is 
based on the maximum solar energy transmittance by glass thickness.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>Heat-absorbing and light-reducing glass is affected by thermal stresses which can result in breakage.  Care should
