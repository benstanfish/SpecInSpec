<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy and Air Force projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

"S" are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Submit the following in accordance

<TXT>Materials delivered to site shall be inspected for damage, unloaded, and stored with a minimum of handling.  Materials shall not be stored directly 
on the ground.  The inside of pipes and fittings shall be kept free of dirt and debris.  Before, during, and after installation, plastic pipe and 
fittings shall be protected from any environment that would result in damage or deterioration to the material.  Keep a copy of the manufacturer's 
instructions available at the construction site at all times and follow these instructions unless directed otherwise by the Contracting Officer.  
Solvents, solvent compounds, lubricants, elastomeric gaskets, and any similar materials required to install plastic pipe shall be stored in accordance 
with the manufacturer's recommendations and shall be discarded if the storage period exceeds the recommended shelf life.  Solvents in use shall 
be discarded when the recommended pot life is exceeded.</TXT><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Where the type of pipe is to be the Contractor's option, the types (with size, class, shape, strength, 
sheet thickness, or gauge) that are acceptable should be listed.  The inapplicable types of pipe will be deleted.  
In specifying plastic and concrete pipe for culverts and storm drains, pipe of comparable strength for the various 
sizes should be specified.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Pipe materials which are known to be unsuitable for local conditions (i.e., corrosion, root penetration, etc.) 
should not be permitted for the project.  However, consideration should be given to the use of protective coatings 
and jointing methods where economically feasible.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>In areas where problems with root penetration are anticipated, specify pipe which has the kind of joint which 
will successfully resist root penetration.  Generally speaking, the more watertight the joint, the greater will 
be the resistance to root penetration.  Rubber-gasketed and compression-type joints are considered to give the 
best performance for this application.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Manual No. 37, "Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers," 
contains methods of calculation for structural requirements of pipe; from these, the required strengths for pipe 
of various materials may determined.  Investigate external loads, including earth loads, truck loads, seismic 
loads, and impact, in the design stage of the project.  Give special attention, in the design stage of the project, 
to plastic pipe materials, particularly with respect to superimposed external loads which could cause excessive 
deflection of the pipe.  The degree of sidefill compaction should be considered realistically, particularly in 
marginal cases.</NPR><BRK/>
