<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose 
the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation 
are for [Contractor Quality Control approval.] [information only.  When used, a designation following the "G" 
designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the Government.]  Submittals with an "S" 
are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.

<NPR>NOTE:  If more than one carpet type is required for a project, use a separate 
paragraph for each carpet type.  Designate each carpet type with a letter or 
number symbol.  Use the same designations to key carpets to locations on the 
drawings and in Section <SRF>09 06 00</SRF> SCHEDULES FOR FINISHES.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>ADA Requirements:  Carpet must be securely attached; have a firm cushion, or 
backing, or no cushion; and have a level loop, textured loop, level cut pile, 
or level cut/uncut pile texture.  The maximum thickness should be<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 
inch</ENG>.  Fasten exposed edges of carpet to floor surfaces and have trim along 
the entire length of the exposed edge.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Nylon fiber is typically abrasion resistant and durable in all pile configurations 
using filament fiber, has good stain removal characteristics, and is recommended 
for commercial installations.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Triexta (PTT) fiber is recommended for residential installations.  Some PTT 
fiber made outside the US can be used in commercial applications, but specification 
of these products must comply with the Buy America Act when applicable.  Triexta 
is marketed as offering excellent durability, resiliency and crush resistance.  
Permanent stain resistance, bleach resistance and colorfastness built into the 
fiber helps to make triexta carpets easy to clean and can extend the life of 
the carpet.  It is important to note that long term performance of triexta fiber 
has not yet been tested.  </NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycled polyester fiber has permanent fade 
resistance, is permanently colorfast, has a permanent stain resistance which 
is higher than other type fibers, is impervious to harsh chemicals, and has 
the lowest static buildup.  PET type polyester carpet, once crushed under continued 
high pressure, is less likely than nylon carpet to rebound.  PET carpet is not 
recommended for severe and moderate wear level areas and should be limited to 
light wear areas.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Wool is a natural fiber, which is inherently flame resistant, forming a char 
that will neither melt nor drip.  Wool is also rapidly renewable and resilient, 
and due to the scaly character of its fiber it scatters optical light, thus 
reducing soiling visibility.  Wool is highly recommended for shipboard use due 
to it being inherently flame resistant.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Wool, cotton, jute, hemp and sisal carpets may not meet accepted performance 
requirements of commercial carpet.  Verify suitability, availability and adequate 
competition before specifying these products.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Flexible and modular components, like carpet tile, reduce the labor and materials 
costs related to operations and maintenance, churn, and future renovations.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Continuous dye process uses two to three times less water than batch dyeing 
during manufacture.</NPR><BRK/>
