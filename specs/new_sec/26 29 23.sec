<NPR>NOTE:  Pulse width modulated (PWM) is the predominant type of adjustable speed 
drive (ASD).  Other ASD types include current source inverter (CSI), voltage 
source inverter (VSI), and flux vector drive (FVD).  For guidance of the proper 
application of ASD's and installation, refer to Appendix B of UFC 3-520-01.  
Since the carrier-frequency pulse output voltage of a PWM cause rapid rise times 
in these pulses, the transmission line effects must be considered.   The resulting 
voltage can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 
3.1 times the rated line voltage, putting high stress on the cable and motor 
windings, and eventual insulation failure.  Use ASD manufacturer recommended 
cable type and maximum safe cable distances before using the external protection 
devices.  Use motors designed for use with ASD.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  The use of power capacitors for power factor correction and/or the use 
of surge protection capacitors on the load side of an electronic control connected

<NPR>NOTE:  Choose one of the bracketed sentences when more than an ASD inherent 
dynamic braking torque is required because an ASD system will produce only 10

<BRK/>
<NPR>External dynamic braking (also may be called "Shunt Regulator" and "Snubber") 
may be used when a shorter decelerating time is occasionally required.  Dynamic 
braking method is releasing the motor generated energy in the form of heat through 
a voltage regulated switching transistor and resistor.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Regenerative braking may be used where a short deceleration time is needed, 
a high inertia is present, or large amounts of energy losses are undesirable.  
The regenerative braking method is changing the ASD DC bus energy into fixed 
frequency utility power.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Common DC bus tie braking may be used together with a dynamic braking as an 
alternative to dissipating the energy by a dynamic brake resistor when several 
controls are used in a process and tied in parallel.  During braking, energy 
is returned to the common DC bus tie and may be used by rest of controls and
