<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification covers requirements for <SCP>building telecommunications cabling systems using a physical 
star network topology for transporting telecommunications signals within a building.</SCP>  Telecommunications cabling 
systems include the copper and optical fiber horizontal and interior building backbone systems and cable media, 
patch panels, connecting blocks, firestopping, grounding, cable support, hardware, communications outlets, connectors, 
and associated hardware; station wiring, work area station outlets (adapters); and distribution terminals.  This 
specification covers telecommunication cabling systems supporting customer's voice, data, video, audio, security, 
digital imaging and environmental control for transporting information throughout modern buildings using twisted 
pair and optical fiber cables.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Telecommunications pathways are specified in Section <SRF>26 20 00</SRF> INTERIOR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  Coordinate electrical, 
grounding, and HVAC requirements with the associated disciplines.<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  UFC 3-580-01, "Telecommunications Building Cabling Systems Planning and Design" provides requirements for 
interior telecommunications cabling systems for DoD.  It is currently being revised to accommodate the USAISEC 
Technical Criteria for Installation Information Infrastructure Architecture (I3A) and the UFC 3-580-10, "Navy 
And Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) Standard Construction Processes".  When UFC 3-580-01 is complete, these documents 
will no longer be valid.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Until then, the Army ECB 2007-22, "Army Installation Information Infrastructure Architecture (I3A) Guide", available 
electronically at <BRK/>
invokes the I3A, and the I3A provides the criteria for Army telecommunications cabling systems.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Similarly, UFC 3-580-01 and UFC 3-580-10, "Navy And Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) Standard Construction Processes" 
provides design requirements for Navy sites.</NPR><BRK/>

For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering
