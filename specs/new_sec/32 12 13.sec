<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy and Air Force projects. <BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation are for information only.  When 
used, a designation following the "G" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the Government.  Submittals with an 
"S" are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Submit the following in accordance

<SPT><TTL>Bituminous Distributor</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Provide a self propelled distributor with pneumatic tires of such size and number to prevent rutting, shoving or otherwise damaging the surface

determined and controlled total liquid rates from<MET> 0.14 to 4.5 L/square meter</MET><ENG> 0.03 to 1.0 gallons per square yard</ENG>, with a pressure range of<MET> 172.4 
to 517.1 kPa</MET><ENG> 25 to 75 psi</ENG> and with an allowable variation from the specified rate of not more than plus or minus 5 percent, and at variable widths.  
Include with the distributor equipment a separate power unit for the bitumen pump, full-circulation spray bars, tachometer, pressure gauges, volume-measuring 
devices, adequate heaters for heating of materials to the proper application temperature, a thermometer for reading the temperature of tank contents, 
and a hand hose attachment suitable for applying bituminous material manually to areas inaccessible to the distributor.  The distributor will be 
capable of circulating and agitating the bituminous material during the heating process.</TXT><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>General</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Following preparation and subsequent inspection of the surface, apply the bituminous prime or tack coat with the bituminous distributor at the 
specified rate with uniform distribution over the surface to be treated.  Properly treat all areas and spots, not capable of being sprayed with 
the distributor, with the hand spray.  Until the succeeding layer of pavement is placed, maintain the surface by protecting the surface against 
damage and by repairing deficient areas at no additional cost to the Government.  If required, spread clean dry sand to effectively blot up any 
excess bituminous material.  No smoking, fires, or flames other than those from the heaters that are a part of the equipment are permitted within<MET>
 8 meters</MET><ENG> 25 feet</ENG> of heating, distributing, and transferring operations of cutback materials.  Prevent all traffic, except for paving equipment 
used in constructing the surfacing, from using the underlying material, whether primed or not, until the surfacing is completed. The bituminous 
coat requirements are described herein.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Prime Coat</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT> The prime coat is required if it will be at least 7 days before the asphalt mixture is constructed on the underlying (base course, etc.) compacted 
material.  The type of liquid asphalt and application rate will be as specified herein.  Protect the underlying layer from any damage (water, traffic, 
etc.) until the surfacing is placed.  If the Contractor places the surfacing within seven days, the choice of protection measures or actions to 
be taken is at the Contractor's option.  Repair (recompact or replace) damage to the underlying material caused by lack of, or inadequate, protection 
by approved methods at no additional cost to the Government.  If the Contractor opts to use the prime coat, apply as soon as possible after consolidation 
of the underlying material. Apply the bituminous material uniformly over the surface to be treated at a pressure range of<MET> 172.4 to 517.1 kPa</MET><ENG> 25 
to 75 psi</ENG>; the rate will be as specified above in paragraph APPLICATION RATE.  To obtain uniform application of the prime coat on the surface treated 
at the junction of previous and subsequent applications, spread building paper on the surface for a sufficient distance back from the ends of each 
application to start and stop the prime coat on the paper and to ensure that all sprayers will operate at full force on the surface to be treated.  
Immediately after application remove and destroy the building paper.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Tack Coat</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A tack coat should be applied to every bound surface (asphalt or concrete pavement) that is being overlaid with asphalt mixture and at transverse 
and longitudinal joints.  Apply the tack coat when the surface to be treated is clean and dry.  Immediately following the preparation of the surface 
for treatment, apply the bituminous material by means of the bituminous distributor, within the limits of temperature specified herein and at a 
rate as specified above in paragraph APPLICATION RATE.  Apply the bituminous material so that uniform distribution is obtained over the entire 
surface to be treated.  Treat lightly coated areas and spots missed by the distributor by spraying with a hand wand or using other approved method.  
Following the application of bituminous material, allow the surface to cure without being disturbed for period of time necessary to permit setting 
of the tack coat.  Apply the bituminous tack coat only as far in advance of the placing of the overlying layer as required for that day's operation.  
Maintain and protect the treated surface from damage until the succeeding course of pavement is placed.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
</SPT><SPT><TTL>CURING PERIOD</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Following application of the bituminous material and prior to application of the succeeding layer of asphalt mixture allow the bituminous coat 
to cure and water or volatiles to evaporate prior to overlaying.  Maintain the tacked surface in good condition until the succeeding layer of pavement 
is placed, by protecting the surface against damage and by repairing and recoating deficient areas.  Allow the prime coat to cure without being 
disturbed for a period of at least 48 hours or longer, as may be necessary to attain penetration into the treated course.  Furnish and spread enough 
sand to effectively blot up excess bituminous material.</TXT><BRK/>
