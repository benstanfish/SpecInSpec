<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy and Air Force projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation are for information only.  When 
used, a designation following the "G" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the Government.  Submittals with an 
"S" are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Submit the following in accordance

power-driven saw.  Construct sawed joints by sawing a groove in the concrete with a<MET> 3 mm</MET><ENG> 1/8 inch</ENG> blade.  Provide an ample supply of saw blades 
on the jobsite before concrete placement is started.  Provide at least one standby sawing unit in good working order at the jobsite at all times

warping of the filler during floating and finishing.  Immediately after finishing operations are completed, round joint edges using an edging tool 
having a radius of<MET> 3 mm</MET><ENG> 1/8 inch</ENG>.  Remove any concrete over the joint filler.  At the end of the curing period, clean the top of expansion joints

material is placed.  Do not spill sealing material on exposed surfaces of the concrete.  Apply joint sealing material only when the concrete at

<SPT><TTL>General Requirements</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Protect concrete against loss of moisture and rapid temperature changes for at least 7 days from the beginning of the curing operation.  Protect 
unhardened concrete from rain and flowing water.  All equipment needed for adequate curing and protection of the concrete must be on hand and ready 
for use before actual concrete placement begins.  Protect concrete as necessary to prevent cracking of the pavement due to temperature changes 
during the curing period.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Mat Method</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Cover the entire exposed surface with two or more layers of burlap.  Overlap mats at least<MET> 150 mm</MET><ENG> 6 inches</ENG>.  Thoroughly wet the mat with water 
prior to placing on concrete surface and keep the mat continuously in a saturated condition and in intimate contact with concrete for not less

<SPT><TTL>Impervious Sheeting Method</TTL><BRK/>

surface with the light-colored side up and overlapped<MET> 300 mm</MET><ENG> 12 inches</ENG> when a continuous sheet is not used.  Use sheeting that is not less than<MET>
 450 mm</MET><ENG> 18-inches</ENG> wider than the concrete surface to be cured.  Secure sheeting using heavy wood planks or a bank of moist earth placed along edges 
and laps in the sheets.  Satisfactorily repair or replace sheets that are torn or otherwise damaged during curing.  Sheeting must remain on the 
concrete surface to be cured for not less than 7 days.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Membrane Curing Method</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Apply a uniform coating of white-pigmented membrane-curing compound to the entire exposed surface of the concrete as soon after finishing as the 
free water has disappeared from the finished surface.  Coat formed surfaces immediately after the forms are removed and in no case longer than 
1 hour after the removal of forms.  Do not allow concrete surface to dry before application of the membrane.  If drying has occurred, moisten the 
surface of the concrete with a fine spray of water and apply the curing compound as soon as the free water disappears.  Apply curing compound in 
two coats by hand-operated pressure sprayers at a coverage of approximately<MET> 5 square meters/L</MET><ENG> 200 square feet/gallon</ENG> for the total of both coats.  
Apply the second coat in a direction approximately at right angles to the direction of application of the first coat.  The compound must form a 
uniform, continuous, coherent film that will not check, crack, or peel and must be free from pinholes or other imperfections.  If pinholes, abrasion, 
or other discontinuities exist, apply an additional coat to the affected areas within 30 minutes.  Respray concrete surfaces that are subjected 
to heavy rainfall within 3 hours after the curing compound has been applied by the method and at the coverage specified above.  Respray areas where 
the curing compound is damaged by subsequent construction operations within the curing period.  Take precautions necessary to ensure that the concrete 
is properly cured at sawed joints, and that no curing compound enters the joints.  Tightly seal the top of the joint opening and the joint groove 
at exposed edges before the concrete in the region of the joint is resprayed with curing compound.  Use a method used for sealing the joint groove 
that prevents loss of moisture from the joint during the entire specified curing period.  Provide approved standby facilities for curing concrete 
pavement at a location accessible to the jobsite for use in the event of mechanical failure of the spraying equipment or other conditions that 
might prevent correct application of the membrane-curing compound at the proper time.  Adequately protect concrete surfaces to which membrane-curing 
compounds have been applied during the entire curing period from pedestrian and vehicular traffic, except as required for joint-sawing operations 
and surface tests, and from other possible damage to the continuity of the membrane.</TXT><BRK/>
