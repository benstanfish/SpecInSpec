<NPR>NOTE:  Review Submittal Description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list, and corresponding submittal items in 
the text, to reflect only the submittals required for the project.  The Guide 
Specification technical editors have classified those items that require Government 
approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other 
submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a "G" to an item if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR><TAI OPT="ARMY">For Army projects, fill in the empty brackets following the "G" classification, 
with a code of up to three characters to indicate the approving authority.  
Codes for Army projects using the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" 
for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering Division or other 
organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident 
Office; and "PO" for Project Office.  </TAI>Codes following the "G" typically are 
not used for Navy, Air Force, and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK/>

and Third Party Certification (TPC) where applicable, with an "S" next to the 
submittal item.  Use the following format to add submittal items in the technical
