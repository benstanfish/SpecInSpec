<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification <SCP>covers general exterior and interior finish 
carpentry in a condensed format and is therefore intended for use on small projects</SCP>.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Consider specifying medium density fiberboard (MDF) composite materials in lieu 
of solid wood.  Made from recycled wood fibers and resin, MDF is machine dried 
and pressed to produce dense, durable, dimensionally stable sheets that perform 
well in moderate heat and humidity.  MDF is a cost effective alternative to 
wood, both initially and throughout its life cycle.  MDF is also referred to 
herein as particleboard.  Evaluate humidity requirements of the project before 
specifying MDF.<BRK/>

harvest levels, protection of water quality, and prompt regeneration (e.g., 
replanting and reforestation); 2) Third-party certification audits performed 
by accredited certification bodies; 3) Publicly available certification audit 
summaries; 4) Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process; 
5) Complaints and appeals process.<BRK/>

Verify suitability, availability within the region, cost effectiveness and adequate 
competition before specifying these sustainably harvested wood certifications
