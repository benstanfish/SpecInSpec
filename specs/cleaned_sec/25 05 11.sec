<NPR>Note: Facility-related control systems are a subset of control systems that are used to monitor and control equipment 
and systems related to DoD real property facilities (e.g., building control systems, utility control systems, 
electronic security systems, and fire and life safety systems).  This section includes Cybersecurity requirements 
to be included on every DOD project which includes a facility-related control system.  This Section does not provide 
general requirements for a control system, nor are the requirements in this section sufficient to procure a control 
system.  This section must be used in conjunction with another controls system specification.  For example, for 
a HVAC controls project, this section should be used in conjunction with Section 23 09 00 and related sections.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Requirements and activities in this section must be coordinated with the other relevant control specification 
sections.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This section includes requirements in support of the DOD Risk Management Framework (RMF) for implementing cybersecurity.  
Refer to UFC 4-010-06, Cybersecurity for Facility-Related Control Systems for requirements on incorporating cybersecurity 
into control system design and for general information on the RMF process as it applies to control systems. Assistance 
for control system cybersecurity is available from the following Service organizations:<BRK/>
   Army: Control System Cybersecurity Center of Expertise, <BRK/>
         Huntsville Engineering and Support Center<BRK/>
<BRK/>
   Navy: Naval Facilities Engineering Command,  <BRK/>
         Command Information Office (CIO)<BRK/>
<BRK/>
   Air Force: Civil Engineer Maintenance,<BRK/>
              Inspection, and Repair Team (CEMIRT)<BRK/>
              ICS Branch, Tyndall AFB<BRK/>
<BRK/>
   Marine Corps: Contact Navy POC for Marine Corps<BRK/>
                 POC information </NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Since this Section covers a wide range of control systems, and those systems often have different capabilities 
and requirements, there are requirements identified in this Section which need extensive designer input or decisions. </NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Many designer selections in this Section will require coordination with the project site, System Owner, Authorizing 
Official or a subject matter expert in the specific control systems being installed.  </NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This Section is for use on control systems with no impact rating higher than LOW.  If the project includes 
systems where there systems with impact ratings of MODERATE or HIGH, this specification must be modified to include 
those additional requirements.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Systems of different types at the same impact level may have different requirements based on the specific needs 
and capabilities of the control system.  This is addressed in this Guide Specification by indicating when requirements 
apply to a specific system type.<BRK/>
Systems of the same type may have different requirements.  This may be due to those systems having different impact 
levels or due to system-specific requirements for systems at the same impact level.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If a project includes multiple systems, it's critical that it be clear which requirements apply to which systems.  
This can be done by a) using a single Section and specifying the applicability of requirements or b) using multiple 
Sections.  Which approach to employ depends on the needs of the project and the preferences of the specifier and 
project manager.  If using multiple sections use the fourth level specification numbering to differentiate the 
Sections and indicate in each which systems the Section applies to.</NPR><BRK/>

list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy,  Air Force, and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>An "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE: The Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule is used in two situations:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>1) The control system communicates with a separately authorized system or an unauthorized system.  In this case, 
include a Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule in the design showing the following interconnection details: 
Name/description of other system, POC for the other system, type of data/information.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>2) The control system is a sub-part of a larger system and will communicate with and integrate to the larger system 
(and will be part of the same authorization as the larger system).  In this case, the control system design must 
include requirements for the expected communication between the sub-system and the larger system.  The Cybersecurity 
Interconnection Schedule will not be a design drawing, but will still be a contractor submittal.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If neither of these situations apply (if the system is stand-alone with no connection or integration to another 
system), remove the bracketed text requiring the Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule, and remove the  Cybersecurity 
Interconnection Schedule from the SUBMITTALS paragraph of this Section.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If Case 1 applies, keep the bracketed text referring to Foreign Destination and POC for Destination, otherwise 
remove this text.</NPR><BRK/>

      support accounts, but other requirements limit<BRK/>
      this to READ-ONLY interfaces.<BRK/>
   3) Thus the "permitted actions" referred to by<BRK/>

<BRK/>
<NPR>DoD also requires that the selection of which events get audited is under the control of the Information System 
Security Manager (ISSM).</NPR><BRK/>
<NPR><BRK/>
DoD requires (see AU-3) that audit records contain the following:<BRK/>
   type of event<BRK/>
   time of the event<BRK/>
   location of the event<BRK/>
   source of the event<BRK/>
   result of the event<BRK/>
   the identity of any individuals or subjects<BRK/>
      associated with the event.<BRK/>
Note that much of this information will be not applicable for field control system devices.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>DoD requires that all devices in the system be capable of auditing events, but allows the ISSM to select which 
devices must perform auditing (see AU-12 (b)).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Note that there is a large gap between what is theoretically required in terms of a capability ("audit all events 
at all devices") vs. what is practical and reasonable to implement in a specific control system.  The designer 
needs to provide input on what can and cannot be done in terms of what devices in the system can perform auditing, 
and what events can they audit.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Require implementation for what is possible but do not require unreasonable requirements.  Be prepared to document/explain 
impractical requirements if required by the System Owner (SO) or Authorizing Official (AO)</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Control System Alarms:<BRK/>
Control system alarms should have similar requirements. The designer should specify what alarms should be generated, 
which devices should perform alarm generation, the accuracy of alarm timestamps, response to alarm generation 
failures (e.g. loss of communication with a field device), and sufficient storage capacity at the front end to 
maintain alarm/event logs for a specified period of time. These requirements should be defined in the relevant

<NPR>NOTE:  A long term alternate power supply is almost never required by the control system itself, this will usually 
be required (if at all) by tenant requirements or by the overall system design and should seldom be added as an 
ad-hoc requirement.  Control systems for underlying systems with alternate power should use that alternate power 
source.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>A UPS may be desired for specific control system components where rapid recovery after a power outage is required, 
or where the control system itself is necessary for restoration of power.  Again, this should be driven by mission 
requirements and control system specifications should already require adequate system restoration after loss of power.<BRK/>
If there are specific requirements for either short-term (UPS) or long-term (generator or alternate power source), 
include them as part of the design and in the relevant specification sections rather than adding requirements 
to this section.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Implementation of boundary protection is typically outside the scope of the controls contractor.  The site 
IT staff should implement boundary protection via rules (e.g. a firewall) isolating the control system from the 
wider network.  This is true even for a control system which will be later integrated to a larger system; the 
field point of connection (FPOC) should be configured to allow the minimum traffic necessary for operation.  Critical 
to this is the Cybersecurity Interconnection Schedule, which defines what traffic must be allowed through the 
boundary for the proper operation of the system.</NPR><BRK/>

cryptography is required.  Select text requiring cryptography.<BRK/>
   3.  The control system contains classified information.  First, confirm that the system truly needs to contain 
classified information - if this is only to fulfil some reporting requirement, consider removing the information 
from the CS and meeting the reporting requirement via some other means.  If the requirement for cryptography cannot 
be eliminated, select text requiring cryptography.<BRK/>
In generally, the need for cryptography should be avoided, or at least minimized. (Note that even for systems 
where cryptography is required, it may not be required at every node and interconnection in the system.) </NPR> <BRK/>
