<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification is applicable to base courses placed directly beneath bituminous surface courses.  
The following must be taken into consideration when editing this specification.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>a.  The material in this specification and on the drawings should be referred to as "aggregate base course (ABC)" 
whenever a base course material with a California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of 80 is required.  "Aggregate Base Course" 
should be retained in the title and the rest of the specification should be edited accordingly to retain the information 
necessary for this material.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>b.  The material in this specification and on the drawings should be referred to as "graded-crushed aggregate 
base course (GCA)" wherever a base material with a CBR of 100 is required.  "Graded-Crushed Aggregate Base Course" 
should be retained in the title and the rest of the specification should be edited accordingly to retain the information 
necessary for this material.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>c.  When this specification is to be used in projects that require both types of materials, the title of this 
specification should be "Aggregate and/or Graded-Crushed Aggregate Base Course".  Care must then be taken to assure 
that the drawings clearly call out which material is being used in any particular place and that this specification 
is edited to retain the information for both types of materials.  If only a small amount of one of these types 
of materials is needed for the project, consideration should be made to determine if only one of these materials 
should be specified and the design adjusted.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy and Air Force projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>
<BRK/></NPR>
<BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation are for information only.  When 
used, a designation following the "G" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the Government.  Submittals with an 
"S" are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Submit the following in accordance

<TXT>When the ABC or GCA is constructed in more than one layer, clean the previously constructed layer of loose and foreign matter by sweeping with 
power sweepers or power brooms, except that hand brooms may be used in areas where power cleaning is not practicable.  Provide adequate drainage 
during the entire period of construction to prevent water from collecting or standing on the working area.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>STOCKPILING MATERIAL</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Clear and level storage sites prior to stockpiling of material.  Stockpile all materials, including approved material available from excavation 
and grading, in the manner and at the locations designated.  Stockpile aggregates on the cleared and leveled areas designated by the Contracting 
Officer to prevent segregation.  Stockpile materials obtained from different sources separately.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>PREPARATION OF UNDERLYING COURSE OR SUBGRADE</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The surface of a cohesionless subgrade or subbase may require stabilization prior to placement of the base 
course.  This may be accomplished by compacting a layer of crushed aggregate into the surface.  It may also be 
obtained by methods based on local experience. The additional crushed aggregate will be considered as part of 
the underlying course and may be paid for or included in the specification section that covers the preparation 
of subgrade or subbase for the particular project.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Clean the underlying course or subgrade of all foreign substances prior to constructing the base course(s).  Do not construct base course(s) on 
underlying course or subgrade that is frozen.  Construct the surface of the underlying course or subgrade to meet specified compaction and surface 
tolerances.  Correct ruts or soft yielding spots in the underlying courses, areas having inadequate compaction, and deviations of the surface from 
the specified requirements set forth herein by loosening and removing soft or unsatisfactory material and adding approved material, reshaping to 
line and grade, and recompacting to specified density requirements.  For cohesionless underlying courses or subgrades containing sands or gravels, 
as defined in <RID>JGS 0051</RID>, stabilize the surface prior to placement of the base course(s).  Stabilize by mixing ABC or GCA into the underlying course 
and compacting by approved methods.  Consider the stabilized material as part of the underlying course and meet all requirements of the underlying 
course.  Do not allow traffic or other operations to disturb the finished underlying course and maintain in a satisfactory condition until the 
base course is placed.</TXT><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>.  Make adjustments in mixing procedures or in equipment, as directed, to obtain true grades, to minimize segregation or degradation, to obtain 
the required water content, and to insure a satisfactory base course meeting all requirements of this specification.  Place the mixed material 
on the prepared subgrade or subbase in layers of uniform thickness with an approved spreader.  Place the layers so that when compacted they will 
be true to the grades or levels required with the least possible surface disturbance.  Where the base course is placed in more than one layer, 
clean the previously constructed layers of loose and foreign matter by sweeping with power sweepers, power brooms, or hand brooms, as directed.  
Make adjustments in placing procedures or equipment as may be directed by the Contracting Officer to obtain true grades, to minimize segregation 
and degradation, to adjust the water content, and to insure an acceptable base course.</TXT><BRK/>

 3 inches</ENG> in compacted thickness.  Compact the base course(s) to a total thickness that is within<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG> of the thickness indicated.  Where 
the measured thickness is more than<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG> deficient, correct such areas by scarifying, adding new material of proper gradation, reblading, 
and recompacting as directed.  Where the measured thickness is more than<MET> 13 mm </MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG> thicker than indicated, the course will be considered 
as conforming to the specified thickness requirements.  The average job thickness will be the average of all thickness measurements taken for the 
job and must be within<MET> 6 mm </MET><ENG> 1/4 inch</ENG> of the thickness indicated.  Measure the total thickness of the base course at intervals of one measurement 
for each 500 square<MET> meters</MET><ENG> yards</ENG> of base course.  Measure total thickness using <MET> 75 mm</MET><ENG> 3 inch</ENG> diameter test holes penetrating the base course.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>COMPACTION</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Compact each layer of the base course, as specified, with approved compaction equipment.  Maintain water content during the compaction procedure 
to within plus or minus 2 percent of the optimum water content determined from laboratory tests as specified in this Section.  Begin rolling at 
the outside edge of the surface and proceed to the center, overlapping on successive trips at least one-half the width of the roller.  Slightly 
vary the length of alternate trips of the roller.  Adjust speed of the roller as needed so that displacement of the aggregate does not occur.  
Compact mixture with hand-operated power tampers in all places not accessible to the rollers.  Continue compaction until each layer is compacted 
through the full depth to at least 100 percent of laboratory maximum density.  Make such adjustments in compacting or finishing procedures as may 
be directed by the Contracting Officer to obtain true grades, to minimize segregation and degradation, to reduce or increase water content, and 
to ensure a satisfactory base course.  Remove any materials found to be unsatisfactory and replace with satisfactory material or rework, as directed, 
to meet the requirements of this specification.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>In addition to the compaction specified, proof roll base course under a flexible airfield pavement in areas designated on the drawings by application 
of 30 coverages for Class IV runways, 8 coverages for runways that support fighter aircraft only, and 4 coverages to all other paved areas,  of 
a heavy pneumatic-tired roller having four or more tires abreast, each tire loaded to a minimum of<MET> 13,600 kg</MET><ENG> 30,000 pounds</ENG> and inflated to a minimum 
of<MET> 862 kPa</MET><ENG> 125 psi</ENG>.  A coverage is defined as the application of one tire print over the designated area.  In the areas designated, apply proof 
rolling to the top of the underlying material on which the base course is laid and to the top of each layer of the completed base course.  Maintain 
water content of the underlying material and each layer of the base course as specified in Paragraph COMPACTION from start of compaction to completion 
of proof rolling of that layer.  Remove any base course materials or any underlying materials that produce unsatisfactory results by proof rolling 
and replace with satisfactory materials.  Then recompact and proof roll to meet these specifications.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>Place the base course(s) so that the completed section will be a minimum of<MET> 600 mm</MET><ENG> [2] [_____] feet</ENG> wider, on all sides, than the next layer that 
will be placed above it.  Place approved material along the outer edges of the base course in sufficient quantity to compact to the thickness of 
the course being constructed.  When the course is being constructed in two or more layers, simultaneously roll and compact at least a <MET> 600 mm</MET><ENG> 2 
foot</ENG> width of this shoulder material with the rolling and compacting of each layer of the base course, as directed.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>FINISHING</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Finish the surface of the top layer of base course after final compaction and proof rolling by cutting any overbuild to grade and rolling with 
a steel-wheeled roller.  Do not add thin layers of material to the top layer of base course to meet grade.  If the elevation of the top layer of 
base course is<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG> or more below grade, scarify the top layer to a depth of at least<MET> 75 mm</MET><ENG> 3 inches</ENG> and blend new material in and compact 
and proof roll to bring to grade.  Make adjustments to rolling and finishing procedures as directed by the Contracting Officer to minimize segregation 
and degradation, obtain grades, maintain moisture content, and insure an acceptable base course.  Should the surface become rough, corrugated, 
uneven in texture, or traffic marked prior to completion, scarify the unsatisfactory portion and rework and recompact it or replace as directed.</TXT><BRK/>
