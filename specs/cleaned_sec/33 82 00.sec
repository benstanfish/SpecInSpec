Quality Control System.   Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in 
context of the project.<BRK/>

For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy,  Air Force, and NASA projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to

twisting.  Under no circumstances shall the cable be paid off from the bottom of a reel.  Check the equipment set up prior to beginning the cable 
pulling to avoid an interruption once pulling has started.  Use a cable feeder guide of suitable dimensions between cable reel and face of duct

defects.  When defects are noticed, stop pulling operations and notify the Contracting Officer to determine required corrective action.  Cable 
pulling shall also be stopped when reel binds or does not pay off freely.  Rectify cause of binding before resuming pulling operations.  Provide

<NPR>NOTE:  The OTDR works on the principal of the amount of light that is reflected back to the source and therefore

It should be noted, however, that the distances needed for accurate OTDR readings must exceed<MET> 100 m</MET><ENG> 328 ft</ENG>.  To 
overcome the long tail on the trace due to the initial reflection at the OTDR connector, a "dead-zone fiber" with 
a length exceeding the displayed pulse duration may be used between the OTDR connector and the specimen.  (Numerically, 
pulse length in meters corresponds to approximately one-tenth the pulse duration in ns.) To avoid the tail, the 
dead-zone fiber length may be up to 20 times the pulse length, depending upon characteristics of the individual 
OTDR.  Recommend a<MET> 20 meter</MET><ENG> 66 feet</ENG> jumper minimum, for testing fiber optic cabling using the OTDR, however on 
long cabling runs this length may be inadequate to overcome the dead-zone and potentially skew test results.

discontinuities, micro-bendings or improper splices for the cable span under test.  Hard copy fiber signature records shall be obtained 
from the OTDR for each fiber in each span and shall be included in the test results.  The OTDR test shall be measured in both directions.  
A reference length of fiber,<MET>[ 20][ ____] m</MET><ENG>[ 66][ ____] feet</ENG> minimum, used as the delay line shall be placed before the new end connector 
and after the far end patch panel connectors for inspection of connector signature.  Conduct OTDR test and provide calculation or interpretation 
of results in accordance with <RID>JIS C 6823</RID> for single-mode fiber and  for multimode fiber.  Splice losses shall not exceed 0.3 db.</TST></LST><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33"><TST>b.  Attenuation Test: End-to-end attenuation measurements shall be made on all fibers, in both directions, using a[ 850][ 1300][ 1310][ 
1550] nanometer light source at one end and the optical power meter on the other end to verify that the cable system attenuation requirements 
are met in accordance with[ <RID>JIS C 6188</RID> for multimode][ and][ <RID>JIS C 6823</RID> for single-mode] fiber optic cables.  The measurement method shall 
be in accordance with <RID>JIS C 6823</RID>.  Attenuation losses shall not exceed 0.5 db/km at 1310 nm and 1550 nm for single-mode fiber.  Attenuation 
losses shall not exceed 5.0 db/km at 850 nm and 1.5 db/km at 1300 nm for multimode fiber.</TST></LST><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33"><TST>c.  Bandwidth Test: The end-to-end bandwidth of all multimode fiber span links shall be measured by the frequency domain method.  The bandwidth 
shall be measured in both directions on all fibers.  The bandwidth measurements shall be in accordance with <RID>JIS C 6824</RID>.</TST></LST><NED/><BRK/>
