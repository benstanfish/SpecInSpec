<NPR>NOTE:  Review Submittal Description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL 
PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Choose the first bracketed item for Navy, Air Force and NASA projects, or choose 
the second bracketed item for Army projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  If sustainable door hardware is available, choose bracketed option.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation 
are [for Contractor Quality Control approval.][for information only.  When used, a designation following the 
"G" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the Government.]  Submittals with an 
"S" are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.

<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Hinges</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Provide in accordance with <RID>JIS A 1510-3</RID>.  Provide hinges that are<MET> 114 by 114 mm</MET><ENG> 4-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch</ENG> unless otherwise 
indicated.  Construct loose pin hinges for interior doors and reverse-bevel exterior doors so that pins are non-removable 
when door is closed.  Other anti-friction bearing hinges may be provided in lieu of ball bearing hinges.</TXT><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Use full-mortise (butt) hinges except where special types are required.  
Use swing-clear hinges where necessary to keep door opening completely clear 
when door is opened 90 to 95 degrees.  Use wide-throw hinges where necessary 
to keep door leaf clear of wall, casings, jambs, or reveals.  Use antifriction-bearing 
hinges on high-frequency or extra-heavy doors, and on doors equipped with closers.  
Use plain-bearing hinges on low-frequency doors up to<MET> 900 mm</MET><ENG> 3 feet</ENG> wide and 
without closers.  Use hospital tips in neuropsychiatric areas of medical facilities.  
In general, full-mortise hinges for interior doors should be steel with BHMA 
600 finish (primed for painting).   Hinges on natural wood or plastic surfaced 
interior doors should be steel with BHMA 652 finish (satin chromium plated) 
or BHMA 639 finish (satin bronze plated) to match finish of other door hardware.  
Hinges for exterior doors should be stainless steel finish or solid brass or 
bronze with BHMA 626 finish.  Use stainless steel with finish on all exterior 
hinges in humid conditions or project locations with Environmental Severity 
Classifications (ESC) of C3 thru C5.  Humid locations are those in ASHRAE climate 
zones 0A, 1A, 2A, 3A, 3C, 4C and 5C (as identified in ASHRAE 90.1).  See UFC 
1-200-01 for determination of ESC for project locations.  Provide interior hinges 
at project locations with ESC classifications of C3 thru C5 of cast or forged 
bronze or stainless steel, Type 302 or 304.  Fire rated doors must have base 
metal of steel or stainless steel.  Plated steel hinges may rust if used on 
exterior doors.  Use two hinges for doors<MET> 1500 mm</MET><ENG> 60 inch</ENG> or less in height 
and one additional hinge for each additional<MET> 750 mm</MET><ENG> 30 inches</ENG> (or fraction thereof) 
of door height.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
1.  Select and size hinges for lead lined, unusually heavy, and high-frequency 
doors on an individual basis.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
2.  The<MET> 114 by 114 mm</MET><ENG> 4-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch</ENG> listed is for<MET> 44 mm</MET><ENG> 1-3/4 inch</ENG> doors 
up to<MET> 915 mm</MET><ENG> 3 feet</ENG> wide and with up to<MET> 20 mm</MET><ENG> 3/4 inch</ENG> trim projection, and 
covers the majority of openings.  For other doors, determine hinge width in 
accordance with:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Twice the door thickness plus trim projection, minus<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG>, or 2(t 
plus p) minus 1/2.  If answer falls between regular hinge sizes, use nearest 
larger size.  Formula is for hinges set back<MET> 6 mm</MET><ENG> 1/4 inch</ENG> from edge of door.<BRK/></NPR>
