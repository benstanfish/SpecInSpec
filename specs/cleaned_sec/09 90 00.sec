<NPR>NOTE:  This Guide Specification is used in the preparation of project specifications 
for Department of Defense facilities: <BRK />
<BRK />
1.  Buildings;<BRK />
<BRK />
2.  Related mechanical, electrical, and miscellaneous items; and<BRK />
<BRK />
3.  Shore-to-ship utility connections.<BRK />
<BRK />
This guide specification WAS NOT prepared to address the requirements of routine 
maintenance painting although it could be modified to do so.<BRK />
<BRK />
This guide specification DOES NOT address high-performance or specialty coating 
requirements, or protective coating of industrial structures or facilities, 
including but not limited to:<BRK />
<BRK />
1.  Towers;<BRK />
<BRK />
2.  Pilings;<BRK />
<BRK />
3.  Pavement markings;<BRK />
<BRK />
4.  Items requiring specialized treatment due to peculiar usage;<BRK />
<BRK />
5.  Petroleum storage facilities;<BRK />
<BRK />
6.  Water storage facilities;<BRK />
<BRK />
7.  Waterfront facilities, except shore-to-ship utility connections; and <BRK />
<BRK />
8.  Hangars<BRK />
<BRK />
If such items are in the project include in a separate section or modify this 
section accordingly.  The following guide specifications are examples of those 
available for specific service conditions noted, and may be modified to provide 
for related service conditions:<BRK />
<BRK />
1.  Section <SRF>09 97 23</SRF> METALLIC TYPE CONDUCTIVE/SPARK RESISTANT CONCRETE FLOOR 
FINISH.  This specification covers the painting of hydraulic structures located 
in fresh water such as locks and dams.<BRK />
<BRK />
2.  Section <SRF>09 97 13.15</SRF> LOW VOC POLYSULFIDE INTERIOR COATING OF WELDED STEEL 
PETROLEUM FUEL TANKS<BRK />
<BRK />
3.  Section <SRF>09 97 13.27</SRF> EXTERIOR COATING OF STEEL STRUCTURES.  This specification 
is usable for any steel structure exposed to weather, and is usable for other 
purposes as well, such as hangar structures, enclosed swimming pool structures, 
and most situations requiring high-performance protective coating systems.<BRK />
<BRK />
4.  Section <SRF>09 97 13.16</SRF> INTERIOR COATING OF WELDED STEEL WATER TANKS<BRK />
<BRK />
5.  Section <SRF>09 97 13.15</SRF> LOW VOC POLYSULFIDE INTERIOR COATING OF WELDED STEEL 
PETROLEUM FUEL TANKS.  This is a three-coat epoxy system that is adaptable to 
a wide range of high-performance protective coating requirements where there 
is no exposure to sunlight.<BRK />
<BRK />
This guide generally contains only two types of coating systems, solvent based 
and water based.  If different systems are required regionally, or for special 
needs, modify the guide accordingly.</NPR><BRK />

PROCEDURES and edit the following list to reflect only the submittals required 
for the project.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require 
Government approval, due to their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, 
other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex 
in context of the project.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up 
to three characters within the submittal tags may be used following the "G" 
designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.</NPR><BRK />

<NPR>NOTE:  Existing coating systems need to be defined compositionally before recoating:</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>1.  Hazardous Materials:  Follow regulatory restrictions when planning either 
partial or full removal of existing coatings.  Records establishing the composition 
of materials in the coating systems, if available, may assist in a preliminary 
review of planned surface preparation and disposal.  Generally an overall assessment 
of applicable regulations for personnel and environmental protection will be 
required, with appropriate sampling and testing, followed by use of proper material 
control procedures.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>2.  Compatibility of the existing coating system with a planned repair or overcoating 
system should be determined by procedures such as the following:</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>a.  Identification of the existing topcoat and any undercoats that will be exposed, 
by consulting local records.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>b.  If binder extraction is possible, ASTM D2621, "Infrared Identification of 
Vehicle Solids from Solvent-Reducible Paints," can be used for vehicle identification.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>c.  General compatibility considerations and chart listings of expected relationships 
between binder types are given in MPI Evaluation of systems, "Transition Coat 
and Architectural Paint Compatibility Chart".  Consult coating specialist codes 
regarding questionable compatibilities indicated in the chart.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>d.  For some maintenance operations, use of ASTM D5064, "Standard Practice for 
Conducting a Patch Test to Assess Coating Compatibility," may be warranted.  
Interpretation of the results of patch testing is not always straight-forward, 
therefore, consult appropriate coating specialists when considering patch testing.  </NPR><BRK />
