<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification is applicable to subbase courses for airfield pavements, roads and streets.  This 
specification will be used for any subbase course that has a design California bearing ratio (CBR) between 20 
and 50.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This specification may also be used for:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>a.  The base course directly beneath the bituminous surface of a pavement design for roads and streets where the 
required CBR value of the material is 50 or more.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>b.  The base course beneath rigid pavements.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>When this guide specification is used for aggregate base course under rigid pavement, section title of the project 
specification will be:  BASE COURSE FOR RIGID PAVING and the words "rigid pavement base course" selected throughout.  
When this guide specification is used in combination for a subbase course under flexible pavements and a base 
course under rigid pavements, the section title will be:  BASE COURSE FOR RIGID AND SUBBASES FOR FLEXIBLE PAVING 
and the words "or rigid pavement base course" will be included after "subbase" throughout.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy and Air Force projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

<TXT>Government approval is required for submittals with a "G" designation; submittals not having a "G" designation are for information only.  When 
used, a designation following the "G" designation identifies the office that will review the submittal for the Government.  Submittals with an 
"S" are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Submit the following in accordance

overlying course material into the underlying course and compacting by approved methods.  Consider the stabilized material as part of the underlying

edge of the surface and proceed to the center, overlapping on successive trips at least one-half the width of the roller.  Slightly vary the length 
of alternate trips of the roller.  Adjust speed of the roller as needed so that displacement of the aggregate does not occur.  Compact mixture 
with hand-operated power tampers in all places not accessible to the rollers.  Continue compaction of the subbase until each layer is compacted 
through the full depth to at least 100 percent of laboratory maximum density.  Continue compaction of the rigid base course until each layer is 
compacted through the full depth to at least 95  percent of laboratory maximum density.  Make such adjustments in compacting or finishing procedures 
as may be directed by the Contracting Officer to obtain true grades, to minimize segregation and degradation, to reduce or increase water content, 
and to ensure a satisfactory subbase and rigid pavement base course.  Remove any materials that are found to be unsatisfactory and replace with 
satisfactory material or rework, as directed, to meet the requirements of this specification.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>In addition to the compaction specified, proof roll subbase course under a flexible airfield pavement in areas designated on the drawings by application 
of 30 coverages for Class IV runways, 8 coverages for runways that support fighter aircraft only, and 4 coverages to all other paved areas,  of 
a heavy pneumatic-tired roller having four or more tires abreast, each tire loaded to a minimum of<MET> 13,600 kg</MET><ENG> 30,000 pounds</ENG> and inflated to a minimum 
of<MET> 862 kPa</MET><ENG> 125 psi</ENG>.  A coverage is defined as the application of one tire print over the designated area.  In the areas designated, apply proof 
rolling to the top layer of the completed subbase course.  Maintain water content of the top layer of the subbase course as specified in paragraph 
COMPACTION from start of compaction to completion of proof rolling.  Remove any subbase course materials that produce unsatisfactory results by 
proof rolling and replace with satisfactory materials.  Then recompact and proof roll to meet specifications.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>Finish the surface of the top layer of rigid pavement base course after final compaction and proof rolling by cutting any overbuild to grade and 
rolling with a steel-wheeled roller.  Do not add thin layers of material to the top layer of rigid pavement base course to meet grade.  If the 
elevation of the top layer of rigid pavement base course is<MET> 13 mm</MET><ENG> 1/2 inch</ENG> or more below grade, scarify the top layer to a depth of at least<MET> 75 
mm</MET><ENG> 3 inches</ENG> and blend new material in and compact and proof roll to bring to grade.  Make adjustments to rolling and finishing procedures as directed 
by the Contracting Officer to minimize segregation and degradation, obtain grades, maintain moisture content, and insure an acceptable rigid pavement 
base course.  Should the surface become rough, corrugated, uneven in texture, or traffic marked prior to completion, scarify the unsatisfactory
