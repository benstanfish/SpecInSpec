<NPR>NOTE:  Welded joints to be inspected will be shown on the drawings, stated in other sections, or added to this 
paragraph.  Because accessibility and geometry of the joint are factors in obtaining adequate ultrasonic penetration, 
consider these factors in the design of the joint.  Drawings or listings in the specifications must clearly indicate 
which weld joints are to be inspected ultrasonically.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The use of advanced ultrasonic techniques in lieu of conventional UT will require the engineer to consider the 
establishment of an acceptance criteria in accordance with AWS D1.1. Prior to proposing the use of advanced UT 
(phased array, TOFD etc) or prior to accepting the proposed use of advanced UT by the fabricator/contractor, the 
engineer will need to establish an acceptance criteria and require an additional procedure submittal for the use 
of advanced ultrasonic techniques.</NPR><BRK/>
