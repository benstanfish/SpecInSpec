<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification applies to Design-Build and Design-Bid-Build projects and covers the requirements 
for <SCP>the preparation and use of construction schedules for small projects</SCP>.  The small projects covered by this 
specification may be simple or complex, but would not benefit from the use of a cost-loaded Network Analysis Schedule 
(NAS) as required by Section <SRF>01 32 17.00 20</SRF> COST LOADED NETWORK ANALYSIS SCHEDULES (NAS).  This specification 
includes two schedule options to choose from based on the complexity of the project.  Edit this specification 
by choosing the desired scheduling option described below.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Confirm with the Administering FEAD/ROICC that the project schedule should be prepared under the requirements 
of this section.  Further, this section should be reviewed and approved by the Administering FEAD/ROICC prior 
to completion of the Request for Proposal.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Option 1: "Non-Cost Loaded Network Analysis Schedule (NAS)" – This is the NAVFAC preferred schedule for use on 
most small projects and requires either Primavera P6 or Microsoft Project 2010 scheduling software to be used.  
Option is provided for cost-loading Microsoft Project 2010 schedules at NAVFAC OCONUS locations where Primavera 
P6 support is not currently available.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Option 2: "Bar Chart Schedule" – In lieu of Option 1 for non-complex projects or projects with minimal disciplines, 
a simple bar chart (Non-NAS) may be specified. Project examples include: paving, painting, roof replacement, and lighting.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Coordination is required with Section <SRF>01 20 00.00 20</SRF> PRICE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES, with selection of "Schedule 
of Prices" for bar charts and non-cost-loaded NAS, or "Earned Value Report" for cost-loaded Microsoft Project 
2010 schedules.<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Review Submittal Description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.</NPR><BRK/>

inspection, testing, and closeout activities.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(2) With the exception of the Contract Award and End Contract milestone activities, use of open-ended activities is not allowed; 
each activity must have predecessor and successor ties.  No activity must have open start or open finish (dangling) logic.  Minimize 
redundant logic ties.  Once an activity exists on the schedule it must not be deleted or renamed to change the scope of the activity 
and must not be removed from the schedule logic without approval from the Contracting Officer.  While an activity cannot be deleted, 
where said activity is no longer applicable to the schedule but must remain within the logic stream for historical record, it 
can be changed to a milestone.  Document any such change in the milestone's "Notebook," including a date and explanation for the 
change.  The ID number for a deleted activity must not be re-used for another activity.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(3) Assign each activity its appropriate Responsibility Code and Area Code, indicating location and responsibility to accomplish 
the work indicated by the activity, Phase Code, and Work Location Code.  Include anticipated tasks to be assigned Government responsibility.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(4) Date/time constraints or lags, other than those required by the contract, are not allowed unless approved by the Contracting 
Officer.  Include as the last activity in the contract schedule, a milestone activity named "Contract Completion Date".</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(5) Include the following Contract Milestones:</ITM><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<ITM>(c) Include Facility Turnover Planning Meeting Milestones;</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(d) Include an unconstrained finish milestone on the schedule titled "Substantial Completion".  Substantial Completion is defined 
as the point in time the Government would consider the project ready for beneficial occupancy wherein by mutual agreement of the 
Government and Contractor.  Government use of the facility is allowed while construction access continues in order to complete 
remaining items (e.g. punch list and other close out submittals).</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(e) Include an unconstrained finish milestone on the schedule titled "Projected Completion".  Projected Completion is defined 
as the point in time the Government would consider the project complete. This milestone must have the Contract Completion Date 
(CCD) milestone as its only successor.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(f)  Include as the last activity on the schedule a finish milestone titled "Contract Completion (CCD)" with constraint type "Must 
Finish No Later Than".  Calculation of schedule updates must be such that if the finish of the "Projected Completion" milestone 
falls after the contract completion date, then negative float will be calculated on the longest path and if the finish of the 
"Projected Completion" milestone falls before the contract completion date, the float calculation must reflect positive float 
on the longest path.  This milestone must be set to 5:00 pm.</ITM><BRK/>

<TXT>Submit a Time Impact Analysis (TIA) with each cost and time proposal for a proposed change.  TIA must illustrate the influence of each change or 
delay on the Contract Completion Date or milestones.  No time extensions will be granted nor delay damages paid unless a delay occurs which consumes 
all available Project Float, and extends the Projected Finish beyond the Contract Completion Date.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">a.  Each TIA must be in both narrative and schedule form.  The narrative must define the scope and conditions of the change; provide start 
and finish dates of impact, successor and predecessor activity to impact period, responsible party, describe how it originated, and how 
it impacts the schedule.  The schedule submission must consist of three native files:</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(1) Schedule Sub-network - Model the scope of the change condition by showing only the schedule activites to be added as a result 
of the change, their immediate predecessor and successor activities in the existing schedule, and how the change activities are 
to be logically tied together.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(2) Update Schedule - Provide the most recently accepted update schedule in effect at the time of the change.  This update schedule 
shall not contain any revisions or additions to the existing logice or activities.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(3) Revised Update Schedule - Provide a schedule that models the effects of the disruption on the update schedule in effect at 
the time of the change.  The revised udate shall have the Schedule Sub-network inserted into the Update Schedule to show how the 
project and scheduled completion date was impacted as a result of the disruption.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">b.  TIAs must include any mitigation, and must determine the apportionment of the overall delay assignable to each individual<BRK/>
delay.  Apportionment must provide identification of delay type and classification of delay by compensable and non-compensable events.  
The associated narrative must clearly describe analysis methodology used, and the findings in a chronological listing beginning with the 
earliest delay event.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(1) Identify and classify types of delays as follows:</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(a) Force majeure delay (e.g. weather delay): Any delay event caused by something or someone other than the Government (including 
its agents) or the Contractor, or the risk of which has not been assigned solely to the Government or the Contractor. If the force 
majeure delay is on the critical path, in absence of other types of concurrent delays, the Contractor is granted an extension 
of contract time, classified as a non-compensable event.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(b) A Contractor-delay: Any delay event caused by the Contractor, or the risk of which has been assigned solely to the Contractor. 
If the contractor-delay is on the critical path, in absence of other types of concurrent delays, Contractor is not granted extension 
of contract time, and classified as a non-compensable event.  Where absent other types of delays, and having impact to project 
completion, provide a Corrective Action Plan, identifying plan to mitigate delay, to the Contracting Officer.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(c) A Government-delay: Any delay event caused by the Government, or the risk of which has been assigned solely to the Government.  
If the Government-delay is on the longest path, in absence of other types of concurrent delays, the Contractor is granted an extension 
of contract time, and classified as a compensable event.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(2) Use functional theory to analyze concurrent delays, where: Separate delay issues delay project completion, do not necessarily 
occur at same time, rather occur within same monthly schedule update period at minimum, or within same as-built period under review.  
If a combination of functionally concurrent delay types occurs, it is considered Concurrent Delay, which is defined in the following 
combinations:</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(a) Government-delay concurrent with Contractor-delay:  Excusable time extension, classified non-compensable event.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(b) Government-delay concurrent with force majeure delay: Excusable time extension, classified non-compensable event.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(c) Contractor-delay concurrent with force majeure delay: Excusable time extension, classified non-compensable event.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM INDENT="-0.33">(3) A pacing delay, reacting to another delay (parent delay) equally or more critical than paced activity, must be identified 
prior to pacing.  Contracting Officer will notify Contractor prior to pacing.  Contractor must notify Contracting Officer prior 
to pacing.  Notification must include identification of parent delay issue, estimated parent delay time period, paced activity(s) 
identity, and pacing reason(s).  Pacing Concurrency is defined as follows:</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(a) Government-delay concurrent with Contractor-pacing:  Excusable time extension, classified compensable event.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<ITM>(b) Contractor-delay concurrent with Government-pacing: Inexcusable time extension, classified non-compensable event.</ITM><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">c.  Submit data containing the narrative and native schedule files.</LST><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33">d.  Unless the Contracting Office request otherwise, only confirmed task order modifications must be added into the Construction Schedule.</LST><BRK/>
