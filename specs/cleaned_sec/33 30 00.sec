<NPR>NOTE:  In areas where problems with root penetration are anticipated, specify pipe which has the kind of joint 
which will successfully resist root penetration.  Generally speaking, the more watertight the joint, the greater 
the resistance to root penetration will be.  Rubber-gasketed and compression-type joints are considered to give 
the best performance for this application.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>When using plastic pipe in areas with contaminated soil or groundwater, consult with the manufacturer regarding 
permeation of pipe walls. When pipe is installed in contaminated soil or groundwater consult with the manufacturer 
regarding selection of appropriate gasket material based on type and concentration of contaminants.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Plastic pipe is subject to temperature limitations which must be observed.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Use caution if considering concrete pipe for septic flows.  Depending on septicity, these pipes may not be satisfactory.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Give special attention in the design stage of project to plastic pipe materials, particularly with respect to 
superimposed external loads which could cause excessive deflection of the pipe.  The degree of sidefill compaction 
should be considered realistically, particularly in marginal cases.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Where different classes, strengths, etc., of pipe are required for different sections of long pipelines due to 
significant differences in external loading, expand or modify the applicable paragraphs of this specification 
accordingly.  Show the limits for each class, strength, etc., either on the project drawings or appropriately 
describe them in the applicable paragraph of the project specification.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Pipe joints:  When more than one type of joint is applicable for the specified piping, permit each as a Contractor's 
option except where watertight joints are necessary or in areas where root penetration problems are anticipated.  
In these cases, rubber-gasketed or compression-type, or solvent-cemented joints are preferred.  Use fuel resistant 
joint gaskets when required.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Review submittal description (SD) definitions in Section <SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES and edit the following 
list to reflect only the submittals required for the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G."  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.  Only add a “G” to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in context 
of the project.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy and Air Force projects.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  
Locate the "S" submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.<BRK/>

"S" are for inclusion in the Sustainability eNotebook, in conformance to Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Submit the following in accordance

obtained, retest pipe by a run from the opposite direction.  If retest continues to show a deflection in excess of 4.5 percent of average inside 
diameter of pipe, replace pipe which has excessive deflection and completely retest in same manner and under same conditions.</TXT><BRK/>
