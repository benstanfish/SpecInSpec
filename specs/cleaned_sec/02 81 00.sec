<NPR>NOTE:  This specification was developed for large management contracts where 
there is a technical evaluation in the selection process.  For small purchases, 
portions of this specification may be applicable, but should be closely considered.  
This specification should be used in conjunction with the separate asbestos 
and PCB management specifications when work involves these hazardous materials.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For other than remedial action, corrective action, or disposal of ammunition 
contract, add DFAR clause 252.223.-7005</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If work does not involve hazardous wastes, submittals regarding the hazardous 
waste management plan, the EPA Biennial and State Annual Reports, exceptions 
reports, and records of inspection may be removed by the designer.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>If work does not involve hazardous wastes, PCB waste, or asbestos containing 
waste, certificates of disposal may be removed by the designer.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Regarding pre-established spill reporting procedures, the designer should consult 
CEMP-RT memorandum of 20 July 1995, Subject:  Spill Reporting Procedures for 
USACE Personnel Involved in HTRW Projects or updated memorandum scheduled to 
be available by Jan 2004.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Security planning requirements (49 CFR 172) contain responsibilities for both 
the offeror of the hazardous material as well as the transporter.  Thus both 
the Government and Contractor have responsibilities for security planning that 
should be coordinated in the development of specific contract specifications.  
Implementation guidance is under development.  The Government will NOT request 
development of, review, or approve the Contractors' security plans.  This is 
a legal requirements placed upon hazmat employers and transporters by DOT.  
The Government will require the Contractor to certify to the Government that 
either a security plan is in place or to document exemption from the security 
plan requirement.  In developing this specification, Designers should determine 
whether this specification requires modification to address Agency specific 
requirements for pre-transportation security requirements in addition to transportation 
related security requirements.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Regarding security plan certifications, for USACE the intent is to obtain a 
Contractor certification for pre-transportation activities as well as a separate 
certification from the initial transporter.  Other agencies may take a different 
approach to implementing security planning requirements and specification should 
be modified accordingly.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
USACE projects require certificates of disposal for all hazardous waste, CERCLA 
remediation wastes, PCBs, radionuclide containing waste, and asbestos as per 
Engineering Pamphlet 415-1-266.</NPR><BRK/>
