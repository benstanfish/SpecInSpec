other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's Quality Control System.  
Only add a "G" to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex

designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" 
for District Office (Engineering Division or other organization in the District 
Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" for Project 
Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy, Air Force, 
and NASA projects.</NPR><BRK />

<NPR>The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required 
for the Sustainability eNotebook to fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements 
in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.  Locate the "S" 
submittal under the SD number that best describes the submittal item.</NPR><BRK />

These specifications conform to the efficiency requirements as defined in Public 
Law (PL) 109-58 - "Energy Policy Act of 2005" for federal procurement of energy-efficient 
products. Equipment selected will have as a minimum the efficiency ratings.<BRK />
<BRK />
Performance requirements for air-cooled chillers are provided in both kilowatt 
(kW)/ton and energy efficiency ratio (EER or Btu/watt) units for convenience. 
When comparing only air-cooled chillers, EER (Btu/watt) is a common metric. 
When comparing air-cooled and water-cooled chillers, kW/ton is a common metric. 
Performance requirements for water-cooled chillers are provided in kW/ton.<BRK />
<BRK />
Equipment having a lower efficiency than FEMP requirements may be specified 
if the designer determines the equipment to be more life-cycle cost effective 
using the life-cycle cost analysis methodology and procedure in 10 CFR 436.<BRK />
<BRK />
The driving forces in the procurement of higher efficient equipment are Executive 
Orders 13423 and 13514.<BRK />
<BRK />
When editing this specification to eliminate a type of chillers technology (oil-free 
magnetic bearings compressors versus oil-lubricated compressors), the design 
analysis must include both calculations to demonstrate that the edit is the 
most LCC effective and manufacturer's literature demonstrating that this edit 
does not result in a sole-source chiller procurement.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>Minimum chiller efficiencies will either be presented in this specification 
or on the design drawings.  Delete chiller efficiencies in the specification 
if efficiencies are shown on the drawings.  If the efficiencies are shown on 
the drawings, reference the applicable AHRI standard.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>Use minimum full load and part load efficiency ratings to specify electrically 
driven, air-cooled and water-cooled water chillers.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>Projects which include vapor-compression type water chillers will comply with 
the safety standards defined in ASHRAE 15.  Designers will be responsible for 
thoroughly researching and implementing the ASHRAE 15 safety requirements.  
For refrigerant-containing parts (excluding piping) located within an indoor 
space, a designer can use the following 6-step synopsis as a guide in determining 
"System Application Requirements" from ASHRAE 15.</NPR><BRK />
<BRK />
<NPR>Step 1.  Identify the safety group classification of the refrigerant anticipated 
to be used in the new water chilling equipment.<BRK />
<BRK />
Step 2.  Identify the occupancy classification of the facility which will house 
the new water chilling equipment.  Occupancies include institutional, public 
assembly, residential, commercial, large mercantile, industrial, and mixed types.<BRK />
<BRK />
Step 3.  Determine the system probability (high or low) of the new water chilling 
equipment.  Water chillers are typically considered low-probability systems 
according to ASHRAE 15.<BRK />
<BRK />
Step 4.  Estimate the quantity of refrigerant (kilograms or pounds) in the largest 
single water chiller or largest refrigerant circuit of the new equipment.  The 
designer will research catalog data from a minimum of two different water chiller 
manufacturers in order to get an approximation.<BRK />
<BRK />
Step 5.  Determine the volume in<MET> cubic meters</MET><ENG> cubic feet</ENG> of the indoor space 
which is planned to house the new water chilling equipment.<BRK />
<BRK />
Step 6.  Identify the "System Application Requirements" from the applicable 
table in ASHRAE 15 based upon the information identified in the previous steps 
(e.g., safety group, occupancy, system probability, refrigerant quantity, and 
indoor space volume).  The "System Application Requirements" will dictate applicable 
refrigerant limitations as well as occupied space or mechanical room requirements.  
Typically, indoor spaces housing water chilling equipment must meet the mechanical 
room requirements defined in ASHRAE 15.</NPR><BRK />

When centrifugal chillers are used for heat recovery duty, the entering heat 
recovery condenser water temperature is usually controlled to between<MET> 35 and 
40 degrees C</MET><ENG> 95 and 105 degrees F</ENG> so that the water temperature leaving the 
heat recovery condenser is high enough to be used as a heat source.  Under these 
conditions, the chiller will be operating at a higher head pressure than normally 
encountered.  At these high head conditions, the centrifugal compressor may 
surge at part-load conditions of as high as 30 percent to 40 percent depending 
upon the conditions to which the chiller is subjected.  In these cases, the 
designer should survey the manufacturers to determine at what load the available 
chillers will surge, at the conditions and loads to be encountered at the site.  
The bracketed sentences will be removed from the centrifugal chiller paragraph 
and replaced with the appropriate capacity control requirements.  The designer 
should also consider multiple chillers to satisfy the load and to partition 
the loading to the chillers such that the heat recovery chiller load is sufficiently 
high to avoid surge.  When examining heat recovery, full consideration should 
be given to the effect of<MET> 35-40 degrees C</MET><ENG> 95-105 degree F</ENG> water and the resulting 
power requirements of the chiller on the economic benefit of heat recovery.<BRK />

<NPR>NOTE: Research local conditions to determine the corrosiveness of the environment.  
Where condenser or evaporator coils are exposed to corrosive atmospheres such 
as sea coast applications, carefully consider the coil and fin combinations 
specified.  Standard coil construction is typically copper tubes with aluminum 
fins.  For more corrosive environments, either copper tubes with copper fins 
or aluminum tubes with aluminum fins should be considered.<BRK />
<BRK />
For maximum coil protection, include the requirements of this paragraph.  This 
paragraph addresses phenolic, vinyl, and epoxy type coatings.  For coils with 
relatively close fin spacing the phenolic or epoxy coating are the preferred 
types as these have less tendency to bridge across the fins than vinyl.  In 
addition, the phenolic and epoxy type coatings can typically provide better 
thermal conductivity than vinyl.<BRK />
<BRK />
If coatings are specified, note that a coil's heat transfer capacity can be 
reduced anywhere between 1 to 5 percent; total unit capacity may have to be 
increased as a result.  Provide coil coatings with 3,000 hour salt spray compliance 
for sea coast installations.</NPR><BRK />

at either the coil or coating manufacturer's factory.  Coating process must ensure complete coil encapsulation.
