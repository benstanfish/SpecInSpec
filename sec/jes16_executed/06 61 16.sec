<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The term "solid surfacing material" encompasses many formulations, including 
100 percent acrylic, and blends of acrylic/polyester called acrylic-modified, 
and other formulations which include such materials as fiberglass for strengthening 
and quartz agglomerates.  Performance characteristics and cost will vary depending 
on the formulation.  For the purposes of this specification, only solid polymer 
materials in 100 percent acrylic, acrylic-modified polyester formulations and 
quartz agglomerates will be considered.  These three materials provide the best 
value in terms of performance and life-cycle cost.  When specifying solid surfacing 
products other than solid polymer and quartz agglomerate, care should be taken 
to fully understand the limitations of these products compared to solid polymer 
and quartz agglomerates with regard to performance characteristics, fabrication, 
and installation.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Veneered products consisting of a thin top layer of solid surfacing material 
with a structural substrate of plywood or particleboard are not considered to 
be solid polymer with respect to this specification.  When specifying a veneered 
product, care should be taken to fully understand the limitations of this product 
compared to solid polymer fabrications with regard to performance characteristics 
and installation.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This specification can be used for counter tops, counter tops with sinks, sinks 
or bowls, <TAI OPT="WINDOW STOOLS">window stools</TAI>, <TAI OPT="SHOWER PARTITION SYSTEM,TUB">tub and shower walls</TAI>, <TAI OPT="SHOWER PARTITION SYSTEM,TOILET">toilet and shower partitions</TAI>, 
wainscoting, <TAI OPT="SHELVING">shelving</TAI>, table tops, hot and cold cafeteria surfaces, flooring 
thresholds, wall panel wainscoting, and other applications where a hard, durable, 
stain resistant surface is desired.  Facility types include, but are not limited 
to: healthcare, institutional, administrative, hospitality, retail, and laboratories.  
The use of solid surfacing material fabrications meets many health, hygiene, 
and durability requirements due to its non-porous and abrasion resistant properties.  
Provide specific project uses in the brackets below.</NPR><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">b.  In most instances, installation of solid surfacing material fabricated components and assemblies 
requires strong correctly located structural support provided by other trades.  To provide a stable, 
sound, secure installation, close coordination is required between the solid surfacing material fabricator/installer 
and other trades to ensure that necessary structural wall support, cabinet counter top structural support, 
proper clearances, and other supporting components are provided for the installation of wall panels, 
counter tops, shelving, and all other solid surfacing material fabrications to the degree and extent 
recommended by the solid surfacing material manufacturer.</LST><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Although solid surfacing materials are fabricated by methods and with 
tools similar to wood fabrications, familiarity with and expertise in fabricating 
solid surfacing material items is essential to achieving high quality results.

from manufacturers standard colors or identified as a manufacturers color in 
this specification only when the project is very simple and has minimal finishes.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>When the Government directs that color be located in the drawings a note must 
be added that states:  "Where color is shown as being specific to one manufacturer, 
an equivalent color by another manufacturer may be submitted for approval.  
Manufacturers and materials specified are not intended to limit the selection 
of equal colors from other manufacturers.  The word "color" as used herein includes 
surface color and pattern."</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Prior to specifying a custom color finish, research to determine if additional 
cost and lead time is feasible.  Note there is often a minimum order requirement; 
this requirement will also affect future orders.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>When a manufacturer's name, stock number, pattern, and color is used, be certain

<BRK/>
<NPR>Availability of material patterns and colors within any particular manufacturer 
may vary depending on the material thickness.  Scratches in some dark colored 
solids and patterns, while repairable, are highly visible until repair takes 
place.  Color selection should be based on material availability and severity 
of end use condition.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The solid surfacing material manufacturing process for products with veining

surfaces.  Gloss ratings are based on standard glossometer readings made at 
a 60 degree angle of incidence.<BRK/>
