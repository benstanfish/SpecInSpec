<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  AREMA No. 5 ballast should only be used around turnouts and other areas 
requiring a smooth walking surface.  Depth of ballast will be indicated on the 
drawings.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>A wide choice of materials may be used for ballast, depending on economics and 
availability.  Prepared ballast is preferred since production can be controlled.  
The use of unprepared ballast for heavy-duty track will increase maintenance 
requirements.  The inapplicable types of ballast will be deleted, and brackets 
will be removed.  The size number will be indicated in this paragraph.  Normally, 
prepared ballast will be used conforming to sizes of gradations established 
by AREMA Manual.  Ballast, crushed stone and slag numbers 4, 4A, or 5 are acceptable.  
Size numbers 4 and 4A are typically mainline ballast materials.  Size number 
5 is typically used on yard and house tracks.  Any or all of these sizes can 
be specified, with a Contractor's option.  The depth and other details of the 
ballast section will be shown on the contract drawings.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Blast furnace slag should be considered a last choice or limited to areas with 
low rainfall and moisture and obtained from a source that is known to have provided 
good performing ballast in recent years.  Most slag ballast tend to cement together 
over time or otherwise disintegrate more rapidly than better quality crushed 
rock.  Water seems to accelerate this process.  (This behavior is much like 
some poorer quality limestones.)  Thus, unless its performance is already well 
known, using slag for ballast is much riskier than using crushed rock.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Subballast should be used in frost areas where the ballast thickness 
requirement exceeds 250 mm.  Where subballast in necessary, 
indicate the kind of subballast to be used; the depth and other details of subballast 
section will be shown on the contract drawings.  In some cases, the subballast 
material may be substituted for the lower portion of the ballast layer.  The 
subballast is often constructed as a filter layer between the ballast and subgrade.  
Gradation of subballast generally ranges from the largest subgrade particles 
to the smaller or middle ballast particle sizes.  Where practical, subballast 
should be placed in layers and thoroughly compacted to form a stable foundation 
for the ballast.  AREMA Manual has a procedure for selecting gradation based 
on gradation of ballast and subgrade.</NPR><BRK/>

spot rail replacement.  Replacement of more than 30 m of contiguous rails is considered to 
be out-of-face rail relay.</LST><BRK/>

<LST INDENT="-0.33">b.  If spikes are withdrawn, plug the holes with treated tie plugs of proper size to fit the hole, prior 
to replacement of rail.  If spikes are withdrawn and spikes are to be redriven in existing spike holes, 
plug the holes with treated tie plugs prior to redriving the spike.  Do not install tie plugs in prebored 
holes unless spikes have been driven and withdrawn.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">c.  Spike all ties with new spikes in accordance with paragraph Spot Tie Replacement.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">d.  Ensure that rail ends at joints are not lipped or uneven.  Ensure tread portion (vertical) or gage 
side (horizontal) rail end mismatch is no greater than 2 mm.  Correct rail end mismatch 
greater than<MET> 2 mm</MET><ENG> 1/16 inch</ENG> by welding and grinding on the smaller rail.  Grinding the larger rail is 
not permitted unless approved by the Contracting Officer.  Make welded transitions at a rate of 1 to 
80.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">e.  Rails removed from track will be designated by the Contracting Officer as relay (for use on project), 
reclaimer (to be salvaged and stockpiled), or scrap.  Joint bars removed from track will be designated 
as relay, reclaimer, or scrap.  Mark scrap materials as scrap using bright red paint, transport them 
off the military installation or to the military installation temporary scrapyard.  Transport relay materials 
required to complete other repair work of this contract to the location of need.  Classify and inventory 
materials and stack at the military installation storage site, all as indicated for salvage materials 
in paragraph Removal, Salvage, and Disposition of Materials.</LST><BRK/>
