<NPR>NOTE:  Determine which roof areas on the structure are considered by the structural 
engineer as functioning as diaphragms for the lateral force resisting system.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Composite decks and diaphragm acting decks, including connections, should be 
designed by the structural engineer according to the Steel Deck Institute.  
Refer to the International Building Code (ICC IBC) and ICC-ES Evaluation Service 
Reports (ESR) based on AC43, Acceptance Criteria for Steel Deck Roof and Floor 
Systems, including diaphragm decks in seismic areas.All connections must be 
shown.  Drawings must show wind uplift loads for roof joist design in addition 
to the items listed below.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For non-diaphragm acting, non-composite decks, the contractor may provide the 
deck design and connections.  In this case, the drawings must show roof live 
loads, including snow loads, and wind loads, including internal and external 
pressures and high intensity zones.  Consider showing a roof uplift and snow 
load plan on the drawings.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>In addition to the above, show the following information on the project drawings:</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>1.  Structural properties (height, sheet thickness, and section moduli or moment 
of inertia).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>2.  Floor and roof deck penetrations.</NPR><BRK/>

raceway.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>6.  Weld or fastener spacing.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>7.  Whether construction is based on shored construction.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Design steel deck to carry the concrete and steel deck dead loads, and the live 
loads during construction before the concrete sets.  Additional concrete dead 
load due to deflection of the deck shall be considered when necessary to prevent 
excessive stresses or deflections in the deck.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Minimum metal thickness should be 0.35 mm for form decks and 0.75 mm 
for roof and composite decks.  However, for corrosive exposures, consider 0.90 
mm minimum thickness.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Specify coated steel for most floor decks and all roof decks. Use Z27 galvanized 
coating or galvalume ASTM A792/A792M for severe corrosive conditions and with 
concrete or spray applied fire protection.  Use Z18 when severe conditions do 
not exist.  Prime painted, not coated, should be specified only for low-budget 
jobs where deck is not critical.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The steel deck shall be designed according to ANSI/SDI C, ANSI/SDI NC or ANSI/SDI 
RD.  Verify grades of steel are appropriate for design.  SDI allows ASTM A653/A653M, 
Grade 230; ASTM A1008/A1008M, Grades C and D; or ASTM A792/A792M.  Phosphatized 
and painted coating is not recommended for the majority of applications.  The 
steel deck specified in this guide specification will be used in conjunction 
with insulation and built-up roofing in accordance with UFC 3-110-03, "Roofing", 
or will be used as a permanent form for concrete or as part of a composite deck 
assembly.  Drawings should show location and extent of steel deck, complete 
structural support including openings greater than 300 mm), type and location 
of accessories, uniformly distributed live loads (positive and negative) in 
kPa (psf), thickness, and required values for section modulus and moment of 
inertia per mm (foot) of width.  Moments of inertia and section modulus values 
will be designed based on procedures set forth in ANSI/SDI C, ANSI/SDI NC and 
ANSI/SDI RD.  Steel decks used as diaphragms must meet the requirements of UFC 
1-200-01, "General Building Requirements" and UFC 3-301-01, "Structural Engineering".  
Subsystems for fire-rated construction, including roof deck, joists, insulation, 
built-in roofing, and ceiling material will be indicated.  When the finished 
installations will be exposed to high humidity, seacoast atmosphere or corrosive 
chemical fumes special care in specifying the finish should be used and individual 
manufacturers should be consulted for the specific application.  Notes on the 
drawings should indicate the attachment method to be used, and should give the 
size and spacing for perimeter, side lap, intermediate supports, and end lap 
attachments.</NPR><BRK/>
