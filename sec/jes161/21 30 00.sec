<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Combustion engine drive must be provided, unless electric power is provided 
from two separate sources.  Dual drive pumps are not permitted.  The primary 
design references for fire pump installations are NFPA 20 Installation of Centrifugal 
Fire Pumps, Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-600-01 Design: Fire Protection 
Engineering for Facilities.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
The Designer will coordinate this specification section with any applicable 
contract sprinkler system.  The designer will provide a fully designed fire 
pump installation in all instances, including projects where the sprinkler system 
will be performance designed.  The following information will be included in 
the contract documents as the basis for any installation:<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(1) All piping, valves, pipe hangers, and equipment including sizes will be indicated.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(2) Freeze protection and ventilation for the pump room or pump house.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(3) Where a pump has a diesel-engine-driver, the pump room or pump house will 
be protected by automatic sprinklers.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(4) The location of either the double-check valve or the reduced-pressure-principle 
backflow preventer where the potable water supply system is at risk of contamination 
by the fire pump(s).  If required, backflow preventers will be installed on 
the discharge side of the pump.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(5) The sequence of operation for the pressure maintenance pump, the primary 
fire pump, and the secondary fire pump.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(6) An equipment schedule for the pressure maintenance pump, the primary fire 
pump, and the secondary fire pump that includes all pertinent information for 
the pumps and their respective drivers.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(7) Waterflow data including hydraulic flow graph and the location where the 
hydrant flow test was conducted, the location and size of existing mains and 
new water supply lines that will serve the fire pump(s) (including all supervisory 
valves), and the location and size of all risers.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
(8) Other design considerations:  Horizontal fire pumps will be provided only 
under a positive head and will not be used where a static suction or lift may 
be involved.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Vertical shaft pumps should take suction from a reliable source that serves 
a wet pit.  Velocities of wet pits and approach channels serving vertical shaft 
turbine fire pumps will not exceed<MET> 0.3 m/s</MET><ENG> 1 ft/sec</ENG>.  Vertical shaft pumps mounted 
over and taking suction from tanks will be avoided.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Hose stream demands must be accounted for in the design so that the pump output 
will not be affected due to low suction pressure and deprive the sprinklers 
of water.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The size of the suction pipe should be such that the velocity does not exceed<MET>
 4.5 m/s</MET><ENG> 15 ft/sec</ENG> when pumps are operating at 150 percent capacity.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Pumps will be located at or above surrounding ground level to avoid any possible 
impairment due to flooding.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Design will indicate pump units and base mounted on a raised reinforced concrete 
pad that is an integral part of an adequately reinforced and supported concrete 
floor.  Vibration isolation for fire pump(s) will be in accordance with UFC 
3-450-01, Noise and Vibration Control.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
In most installations, fire pumps will be automatically activated by a change 
in water pressure in accordance with the recommended pressure settings listed 
in NFPA 20.  Where the water supply pressure fluctuates to the extent that the 
pressure cannot be reliably used or where the water pressure is too low to activate 
the fire pumps, the pumps will be activated by waterflow in the sprinkler or 
fire protection system.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
There may be conditions when manually stopping of the fire pump is required 
instead of automatic stopping.  For example, NFPA 409, Standard on Aircraft 
Hangars, requires that fire pumps serving aircraft hangars be manually stopping 
only.  For these special cases, Paragraph Sequence of Operation would require 
editing.</NPR><BRK/>

For installations where there is a base fire alarm system which is capable of 
distinguishing between alarms and supervisory signals (e.g., radio systems, 
multiplex systems, digital alarm communication systems, or other supervised 
systems with similar capabilities,) the preferred method of remote pump supervision 
is via the supervised alarm system, not via a remote pump trouble panel.  A
