, is an integral part of the building's air barrier pressure test.  Data obtained during the test may be input 
into the spreadsheet to determine the air barrier's leakage rate. <BRK/>
<BRK/>
This specification describes the responsibilities of the contractor and the contractor's pressure test agency.  
The building designer is responsible for creating, defining and detailing the air barrier envelope.  The contractor's 
pressure test agency is responsible for preparing the building envelope for the pressure test, performing the 
test, recording test results, and returning the building to pre-test conditions.  The test agency is also responsible 
for performing the calculations to determine if the envelope passed the pressure test.  Diagnostic testing is 
also the responsibility of the test agency.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This specification does not cover duct and HVAC system pressure testing and is limited to the envelope penetrating 
dampers as deemed applicable for leakage testing.  Duct and HVAC system pressure testing references can be obtained 
from ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2017, HVAC Design Section and Chapters and ASHRAE Standard 215, Method of 
Test to Determine Leakage of Operation HVAC Air Distribution Systems, should duct and HVAC system pressure testing 
be required by other specifications.  See Section <SRF>23 05 93</SRF>, TESTING, ADJUSTING, AND BALANCING FOR HVAC SYSTEMS

</SPT><SPT><TTL>DEFINITIONS</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The following terms as they apply to this section:</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Air Barrier Envelope</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The surface that separates the inside air from the outside air.  The combination of air barrier assemblies and air barrier components, connected 
by air barrier accessories are designed to provide a continuous barrier to the movement of air through an environmental separator.  A single building 
may have more than one air barrier envelope.  The air barrier surface includes the top, bottom, and sides of the envelope.  The term "air barrier 
envelope" is also known as "air barrier system" or simply "air barrier".</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Air Leakage Rate</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>How leaky, or conversely how air tight a building envelope is.  The air leakage is normally described in terms of air flow rate for the surface 
area of the envelope at a defined differential pressure.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Bias Pressure</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Also known as zero flow pressure, baseline pressure, offset pressure or background pressure.  With the envelope not artificially pressurized, bias 
is the differential pressure that always exists between the envelope that has been prepared (sealed) for the pressure test and the outdoors.  Bias 
pressure is made up of two components, fixed static offset (usually due to stack effect or the HVAC system) and fluctuating pressure (usually due 
to wind or a moving elevator).  Because of pressure fluctuations many bias pressure readings are recorded and averaged for use in the calculations.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Blower Door</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Commonly used term for an apparatus used to pressurize and depressurize the space within the building envelope and quantify air leakage through 
the envelope.  The blower door typically includes a door fan and an air resistant fabric or a series of hard panels that extends to cover and seal 
the door opening between the fan shroud and door frame.  The door fan is a calibrated fan capable of measuring air flow and is usually placed in 
the opening of an exterior door. With the air barrier otherwise sealed, air produced by the door fan pressurizes or de-pressurizes the envelope, 
depending on the fan's orientation.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Environmental Separator</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The parts of a building that separate the controlled interior environment from the uncontrolled exterior environment, or that separate spaces within 
a building that have dissimilar environments.  The term "environmental separator" is also known as the "control layer".</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Pressure Test</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A generic term for a test in which the envelope is either pressurized or de-pressurized with respect to the outdoors.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Negative Pressure Test (Depressurization Test)</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A test wherein air inside the envelope is drawn to the outdoors.  This places the envelope at a lower (negative) pressure with respect to the outdoors.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Positive Pressure Test (Pressurization Test)</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A test wherein outdoor air is pushed into the envelope.  This air movement places the envelope at a higher (positive) pressure with respect to 
the outdoors.</TXT><BRK/>

it would be in drier conditions.  Rainwater can also block pneumatic tubes used in pressure testing thereby altering 
differential pressure readings. </NPR><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>For safety reasons, avoid testing during rain or if rain is anticipated during testing.  If pneumatic hoses are installed and exposed to rain inspect 
the hose to insure rainwater has not migrated into the hose ends.  Orient all exposed hose ends to keep them out of water puddles.  Success in

<BRK/>
<TXT>Notify the Contracting Officer at least 10 working days before conducting the pressure tests to provide the Government the opportunity to witness 
the tests and to monitor weather forecasts for conditions favorable for testing.  Do not pressure test until verifying that the continuous air 
barrier is in place and installed without failures in accordance with installation instructions.  During the pressure test periodically inspect 
temporarily sealed items to ensure they are still sealed.  Seals on temporarily sealed items tend to release more readily at higher pressures.  
Test data obtained after temporarily sealed items become unsealed cannot be used as input into the calculation program.  Follow the Envelope Pressure 
Test Procedures in the paragraphs below.  Submit detailed <SUB>pressure test procedures</SUB> indicating the test apparatus, the test methods and procedures, 
and the analysis methods to be employed for the building envelope pressure (air tightness) test.  Submit these procedures not later than 60 days 
after Notice to Proceed.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Extend Pneumatic Tubes and Establish a Reference Differential Pressure </TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Confirm the various zones within the envelope have a relatively uniform interior pressure distribution by establishing a representative differential 
pressure between the envelope and the outdoors with blower door or trailer-mounted fans operating.  The number of indoor pressure difference measurements 
(pneumatic hoses) required depends on the number of interior zones separated by bottle necks that could create significant pressure drops (e.g. 
doorways and stairwells).  Extend at least four pneumatic hoses (differential pressure monitoring ports) to locations within the envelope that 
are physically opposite of each other.  In multiple story buildings, especially those over three stories, extend hoses to multiple floors.  Locate 
the hose ends away from the effects of air discharge from blower test equipment.  Select one of the four (or more) interior hoses, one judged by 
the test agency to be the most unaffected by air velocity produced by blower test equipment, to serve as the interior reference pressure port.  
Extend at least one additional pneumatic hose to the outdoors (outdoor pressure port).  To the end of this hose manifold at least four hoses together 
and terminate each hose on a different side of the building.  With the envelope sealed and the blowers energized, measure the differential pressure 
using the interior reference pressure port and the four outdoor pressure ports.  Then measure and record the differential pressure by individually 
using each of the remaining three interior hoses.  Ensure each reading is within plus or minus 10 percent of the reference reading.  Thus at an 
average 75 Pa maximum pressure difference across the envelope, the difference between the highest and lowest interior pressure difference measurements 
should be 15 Pa or less.  If this condition cannot be met, attempt to create additional air pathways within the envelope to minimize pressure differences 
within the envelope. If necessary, move the interior hose ends.  See step 2.13 of the Air Leakage Test Form in Appendix A.</TXT><BRK/>

<TXT>With the fan pressurization equipment de-energized and the envelope sealed, obtain the differential pressure between the outdoors and the envelope.  
Record 12 bias pressure readings before the pressure test and 12 bias pressure readings after the pressure test.  Each reading is the average of 
ten or more 1-second measurements.  Include positive and negative signs for each reading.  To help dampen bias pressures that significantly contribute 
to test pressure, reduce temperature differences between indoor and outdoor air.  Temperature differences can be reduced by operating test fan 
equipment for a few minutes to replace most of the indoor air with outdoor air.</TXT><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  The preferred way to dampen bias pressure due to wind is to test the building envelope in both the pressurization 
and depressurization directions and average the results.  Bias pressures are non linear and cannot be adequately 
allowed for by merely subtracting the bias from the pressure reading. Testing in both directions more effectively 
dampens bias pressures thus tolerating the occurrence of larger bias pressures during a test, up to 30 percent 
of the lowest test pressure.  Allow single direction testing only if testing in both directions cannot logistically 
be performed.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The preferred method for testing a building envelope is to test in both the pressurized and depressurized directions.  Testing in one direction 
is only allowed if opposite direction testing cannot logistically be performed due to test equipment limitations or restrictions.  After obtaining 
the pre-test bias differential pressure readings, conduct the pressure test.  Record the envelope pressures (in units of Pascals) from one interior 
pneumatic hose (monitoring port) and the outdoor pneumatic hose(s), averaged or manifolded, with corresponding flows (in units of<MET> L/s</MET><ENG> cfm</ENG>) for 
each fan.   Record the flow rates at at least 10 to 12 positive and 10 to 12 negative building pressure readings.  If conducting both positive 
and negative pressure tests the lowest allowable test pressure is 40 Pa and the highest test pressure is 85 Pa.  Keep at least 25 Pa difference 
between the lowest and highest test pressure readings.  Include the 75 Pa pressure value between the lowest and highest readings.  The 10 to 12 
readings in each direction are to be roughly evenly spaced along the range of pressures and flows.  After testing is complete de-energize the equipment 
used to provide pressurization and obtain an additional 10 to 12 post-test bias pressure readings.  None of the bias pressure readings are allowed 
to exceed 30 percent of the minimum test pressure.  If these limits are exceeded the test fails and must be repeated. </TXT><BRK/>

<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Allowing testing in only one direction, acknowledges that very large buildings may require truck or trailer 
mounted blower equipment that logistically will not easily allow testing in both positive and negative directions.  
Because bias pressures will have a greater impact on single-direction tests, the maximum allowable bias pressure 
under these circumstances is 10 percent of the lowest test pressure.  At these generally higher pressures, the 
effects due to bias pressure is somewhat masked by the higher test pressure range. Because building envelopes 
are often leakier when measured in one direction than the other, testing in only one direction is considered less 
accurate than testing in both directions.  Assume for example, that the bias pressure in a<MET> 12 m</MET><ENG>40 foot</ENG> high building 
envelope where the temperature is<MET> -18 degrees C</MET><ENG> 0 degrees F</ENG> outside and<MET> 20 degrees C</MET><ENG> 68 degrees F</ENG> inside and with 
negligible wind is 10.5 Pa. This bias pressure can typically be assumed to be 5.25 Pa at the top of the building 
envelope and -5.25 Pa at the bottom of the building envelope.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Select the 50 to 85 Pa range for all Army and Navy projects.  Select the 25 to 50 Pa range only for Air Force 
projects.  Note that the 25 to 50 Pa range is more susceptible to inaccuracies in test data due to wind.</NPR><BRK/>

evenly spaced pressure readings over a pressure range of [50 to 85][25 to 50] Pa.  After the data is recorded, de-energize the blower equipment 
and obtain an additional 10 to 12 bias pressure readings.  None of the bias pressure readings may exceed 10 percent of the minimum test pressure.

is placed in the closed position. Should leaks be discovered during diagnostic tests, thoroughly document their exact locations on a floor plan 
so that sealing can be later applied, if required or as directed.  If the envelope passes the leakage test, use the diagnostic test procedure described

methods to establish a minimum of +20 Pa pressure difference with respect to the outdoors while using an infrared camera to view the envelope from 
outdoors. When viewing with the camera from inside the envelope, keep the envelope at a pressure differential of -20 Pa with respect to the outdoors 
using pressure testing equipment or the building's own air handling system.</TXT><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>Document the location of all leaks, anomalies, and unusual thermal features on a floor plan and/or elevation view and catalog them with a visible 
light picture for locating the defect for correction.  The thermographer is to recommend corrective actions to eliminate the leaks, anomalies and 
unusual thermal features.  Where leaks are found perform corrective sealing as necessary to achieve the whole envelope air leakage rate specified.  
After sealing, again use thermography in concert with standard pressurization methods to verify that the air leakage has been reduced.  After these 
leaks have been permanently sealed note all actions taken on the drawings or in the Thermographic Investigation Report.  Submit the drawings for 
approval as part of the Thermographic Investigation Report.  Also include thermographic photos that show where leaks were discovered.  Include 
thermograms using an imaging palette that clearly shows the observed thermal patterns indicating air leakage.  The Contracting Officer's Representative 
is to witness all testing.</TXT><BRK/>

<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  A fog generator is an electrical device that heats a water-based fluid and converts it into a safe, breathable 
and relatively buoyant fog.  This fog can be issued towards a building interface from a distance of<MET> 6 m</MET><ENG> 20 feet</ENG>
 or greater.  Consumer grade fog generators are commonly used for parties or during the Halloween season.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Before using a theatrical fog generator, disable all building smoke detectors as they may alarm when fog is issued.  Coordinate fog tests and the 
disabling of all smoke detectors with the Contracting Officer's representative and the local fire department as necessary.  Use pressure test equipment 
or the buildings own air handling system to positively pressurize the building envelope to at least 25 Pa but not greater than 85 Pa over the outdoors.  
Using a theatrical fog generator within the envelope, direct fog at suspected leakage points such as at building interfaces.  Test the following 
interfaces: roof/wall, wall/wall, floor/wall, wall/window, roof/mounted mechanical equipment.  From the vantage point immediately outside the envelope 
and opposite that of the interface being tested, observe the effect as the fog is issued.  Detection may also be further enhanced by using a scented 
fog liquid or a fog liquid that produces a colored fog.  Look for fog and smell for associated odor percolating through the interface.  Also use 
smoke puffers and smoke sticks as necessary to locate leaks at these and other interface locations. If the Architectural Plus HVAC System pressure 
test will be/was performed introduce fog into ductwork to check for leakage between ductwork and associated dampers.  After fog testing has ended, 
reactivate the building smoke detectors and notify the Contracting Officer and local fire department that the test has ended.  After sealing has 
been completed retest these areas using fog.  Seal additional leaks that are found.</TXT><BRK/>
