<NPR>NOTE:  UFC 3-101-01 Architecture gives air barrier system requirements for new construction and renovations.  <BRK />
<BRK />
Testing of the air barrier system is covered in the companion UFGS <SRF>07 05 23</SRF> PRESSURE TESTING AN AIR BARRIER SYSTEM 
FOR AIR TIGHTNESS.  If air barrier system testing is required by the UFC, the testing specification must accompany 
this specification in the construction documents.<BRK />
<BRK />
This specification is applicable to air barrier systems installed in new building construction and in major renovations 
involving upgrade to the building envelope; it is not applicable to unconditioned buildings.  This specification 
is intended to define Contractor responsibilities for the construction of the air barrier system across the six 
sides of a building that when installed properly will control the infiltration or exfiltration of air through 
the air barrier system.  A tight building is essential to a properly functioning HVAC system, to reduce energy 
consumption, and to prevent problems arising from excessive infiltration or exfiltration into or out of the environmentally 
conditioned spaces.<BRK />
<BRK />
UFC 3-101-01 Architecture is recommended reading for the designer.  Also recommended is "Air Barrier Systems in 
Buildings" by Wagdy Anis, FAIA; available at <URL HREF="http://www.wbdg.org/resources/airbarriers.php">http://www.wbdg.org/resources/airbarriers.php</URL>.<BRK />

Applications and Strategies.<BRK />
<BRK /></NPR>
<NPR>AIR BARRIER SYSTEM CONCEPTS AND DESIGNER NOTES:<BRK />
<BRK />
1. Design a continuous air barrier system to control air leakage into, or out of, the conditioned space.<BRK />
<BRK />
2. On drawings dedicated to the air barrier system, identify the surface boundary of the building air barrier 
system in plan and in building section views.  Think of the air barrier system as a sealed balloon.<BRK />
<BRK />
3. Keep in mind that window and door components are part of the building air barrier system.  One must be able 
to trace a continuous plane of air-tightness throughout each air barrier system envelope.<BRK />
<BRK />
4. Of course, intake, exhaust, and relief dampers are part of the air barrier system.  If these dampers are not 
located at or near the building wall, then the duct between the air barrier in the exterior wall and the damper 
is also part of the air barrier system and must be well sealed.<BRK />
<BRK />
5. Walls of ventilated crawl spaces logically cannot be the boundary of the air barrier system.  Nor can the roof 
above a ventilated attic be part of an air barrier system.<BRK />
<BRK />
6. Defining the air barrier system boundary is the responsibility of the building designer.  Plan views should 
show the horizontal outline (by dashed lines) of the air barrier system and any individual air barrier zones.  
Rooms with permanent fixed openings to the outdoor environment cannot be included in the air barrier envelope 
because such openings would represent a hole in the air barrier envelope (the balloon). <BRK />
<BRK />
7. Building and/or wall sections should show the vertical outline (by dashed lines) of the air barrier system 
from floor to roof or ceiling. <BRK />
<BRK />
8. Wall and roof sections and details should show the location of the air barrier membrane within the exterior 
building envelope.<BRK />
<BRK />
9. Air barrier materials located on the outboard side of the wall system and the interior side of the insulation 
attached to a durable substrate is subject to less expansion and contraction than if located on the outer side.  
Additionally this location is the proper hygrothermal location for the vapor plane of the wall assembly for stud 
cavity or masonry block walls.  The concrete material can act as the air/water/vapor barrier on pre-cast, cast-in-place 
concrete, and Insulated Concrete Form (ICF) walls.<BRK />
<BRK />
10. Air barrier materials that also serve as interior finishes are discouraged because such materials are subject 
to damage, difficult to seal, and often compromised by occupant penetrations.<BRK />
<BRK />
11. An air barrier material located on the outboard side of the exterior wall assembly can often serve as the 
air, vapor and water resistive layer of the wall system.  Common stud cavity or masonry wall types must incorporate 
an air/water/vapor control layer on the outboard side of the wall assembly and when doing so, this should be a 
Class 1 vapor barrier/retarder by material permeance.  Applying an air barrier will establish the vapor plane 
of the wall system in the correct location and allow inward and outward drying potential for the assembly from 
this plane.  Consider the vapor permeance of all materials and their relative position within the exterior envelope 
to assure the increasing permeance of the materials from the vapor plane to the inner, conditioned space surface 
of the wall system.  Particular attention should be paid to the climatic conditions the wall system will be situated 
in and experience over the lifetime of the assembly.  Air barrier materials may have low water vapor permeance 
and act as intended, or if located incorrectly, unintended vapor retarders or barriers.  Other materials used 
with the envelope may also have low water vapor permeance.  Careful consideration regarding the location of such 
materials is crucial to avoid vapor barrier temperature below the dew point temperature of the air on either side, 
and to avoid double vapor barriers that prevent inward drying to the conditioned space and can trap condensation 
within the thermal envelope.  Such conditions can contribute to mold problems and material failure problems.  
The thermal resistance, vapor permeance, and relative thermal position of the component materials must be selected 
such that at all locations within the envelope, the dew point temperature is less than the local surface temperature.<BRK />
<BRK />
If software such as WUFI hygrothermal modeling is available use it to verify wall system performance or to model 
unique conditions or building applications that are atypical for a given condition or climate.<BRK />
<BRK />
12. Keep in mind that air barrier membranes must withstand forces due to positive and negative pressures caused 
by wind and Stack Effect.  As a point of reference, many roofs are designed for a wind uplift pressure of<MET> 4.3 
kPa</MET><ENG> 90 lb/sq.ft</ENG>.  Building wraps are particularly susceptible to wind forces unless sandwiched between rigid wall 
components (example: sheathing and board insulation). Otherwise, wraps may experience excessive flexing and stressing 
and point loading of the securing fasteners.<BRK />
<BRK />
13. On the drawings, identify each air barrier material, membrane, coating, window component, door component, 
dampers, and other components that compose the continuous air barrier envelope.  Materials that are part of the 
designated continuous air barrier system must be identified as such. Although many materials used in exterior 
assemblies are air tight, they may or may not serve as part of the designated continuous air barrier system.<BRK />
<BRK />
14. In a roof assembly, locate the air barrier material on the inside of the insulation and attached to a durable 
substrate.  Roof assemblies shall be designed in accordance with UFC 3-110-03 Roofing, updated Jan 2017.<BRK />
<BRK />
15. Detail the connection of roof and wall air barrier materials.  The roof-wall interface has been the source 
of major air infiltration and exfiltration in the past due to the many irregularly shaped decking and structural 
support members intersecting at this point, and insufficient attention to detail to the air barrier system at 
this location.  Although sequencing the connection of the roof-wall air barriers is the Contractor's responsibility, 
drawing notes suggesting a sequence of the trades may serve as helpful reminders to the installer. <BRK />
<BRK />
16. Detail the connection of wall and floor air barrier materials.<BRK />
<BRK />
17. Detail the connection of the wall air barrier materials to window and door components.<BRK />
<BRK />
18. Detail the penetrations of the air barrier envelope by pipe, ducts, and conduit showing the method of sealing 
the penetration.<BRK />
<BRK />
19. Detail the air barrier material to be continuous under or around all electrical boxes and panels, plumbing 
fixture boxes, and other items affecting air barrier system continuity.  Do not penetrate the air barrier envelope 
with lighting fixtures.  Continuity and air tightness is easier to achieve when air barriers materials are located 
outboard of the cavities that contain wiring, conduit, and plumbing.<BRK />
<BRK />
20. In other specification sections, specify the air barrier materials used in the system.  As defined by The 
Air Barrier Association of America (ABAA) all air barrier materials must have an air permeance less than<MET> 0.02 
L/s-m<SPS>2</SPS></MET><ENG> 0.004 CFM/sq-ft</ENG> at 75 Pa when tested in accordance with ASTM E2178.<BRK />
<BRK />
21. Identify the allowable leakage rates of windows, exterior doors, curtain wall assemblies, skylights, dampers, 
and all other such air barrier components in the specification sections covering these components.<BRK />
<BRK />
22. Note that the Energy Star program has no air leakage requirement for windows and doors.  However, ASHRAE 90.1 
contains maximum leakage values for fenestration and doors determined in accordance with NFRC 400. These are minimal 
requirements and do not represent state of the art.  The IECC standard contains leakage limits for doors and windows 
that may be useful as a guideline.  Be sure the specifications for fenestration and doors include maximum air 
leakage values.<BRK />
<BRK />
23. Leakage rates for sectional type overhead doors are published by manufacturers, however, there is no known 
manufacturer who publishes tested leakage performance for roll-up type overhead door assemblies.  For roll-up 
type doors, specify the best weatherstripping available in the specification section covering overhead doors and 
specify a maximum leakage when such ratings are available.  <BRK />
<BRK />
24. Where louvered smoke ventilation openings are used at the top of elevator shafts, provide a motorized damper 
which is sprung normally open and held closed by the damper actuator.  Connect the actuator to the fire alarm 
system to open the damper upon a building alarm.  Refer to IBC Section 3004 Hoistway Venting.<BRK />
  <BRK />
25. Provide tight sealing dampers and controls to close all ventilation or make-up air intakes and exhausts during 
inactive or unoccupied periods.  In the HVAC and building controls specification sections, specify all intake, 
relief, and exhaust dampers to be AMCA 511 leakage Class 1A <MET>(15.2 L/s/square meter@250 Pa</MET><ENG>(3 CFM/sq.ft. @ 1 in.w.c</ENG>).<BRK />
<BRK />
26. Often, there is but one air barrier envelope in a building and this single envelope may enclose the entire 
volume of the building or a portion of the building.<BRK />
<BRK />
27. However, some buildings call for multiple air barrier envelopes.  An example is in a vehicle maintenance facility; 
the air conditioned administrative office area must have an air barrier envelope system complete and separate 
from the air barrier envelope serving the maintenance area so that the admin area air barrier system is not nullified 
during warm weather when the vehicle maintenance bay doors are open.  The common wall between the two areas is 
a part of the air barrier envelope for both areas.  Therefore, the common wall must be tightly constructed and 
must include an air barrier material.  Note that, in this case, the common wall is included in the calculation 
of the air barrier surface area.<BRK />
<BRK />
28. Sometimes the entire air barrier envelope cannot be tested at once.  An example is a building with multiple 
living quarters separated by full height partitions and without an interior corridor.  If there is no discernable 
air path connecting the rooms (such as interior doorways or common ceiling plenums), testing the entire building 
air barrier envelope is precluded.<BRK />
<BRK />
29. In this case, portions of the air barrier envelope should be tested.  Selected rooms must be air pressure 
tested to determine the leakage through the portion of the air barrier envelope shared by the selected rooms.  
On the drawings, identify representative rooms at the exterior corners and rooms not at building corners to be 
tested, and in this specification, give the room number air barrier envelope area and leakage requirements for 
each room to be tested.  Note the air barrier envelope surface area is only that portion of air barrier perimeter 
envelope shared by the room, it is not the entire room surface area.  Testing in this situation requires pressurizing 
adjacent rooms so that there is no room-to-room air leakage.  For a description of the test process, Refer to 
UFGS <SRF>07 05 23</SRF> PRESSURE TESTING AN AIR BARRIER SYSTEM FOR AIR TIGHTNESS paragraph Pressure Testing a Multiple Isolated 
Zoned Building. Where a number of rooms have the same dimensions, the drawings should indicate that the test room 
will either be the room indicated or a room of the same size selected by the Contracting Officer.<BRK />
<BRK />
30. On the drawings, the designer must identify the envelopes to be tested, usually by number. Refer to paragraph 
AIR BARRIER ENVELOPE SURFACE AREA AND LEAKAGE REQUIREMENTS. <BRK />
<BRK />
31. Calculate the air barrier envelope surface area <MET>(sq. m</MET><ENG>(sq.ft.</ENG>) for each envelope to be tested.  This is the 
surface area of the volume enclosed by each air barrier envelope to be tested (includes floors, walls, fenestration, 
doors, and roof).  On the drawings or in this specification, indicated the surface area for each air barrier envelope 
to be tested.<BRK />
<BRK />
32. Two tests can be performed for the building envelope; an "Architectural Only Test", and an "Architectural 
Plus HVAC System Test". The Architectural Only Test calculates the leaking through the architectural portions 
of the envelope and allows some expedient sealing of many HVAC components to exclude any leakage through these 
items from test results.<BRK />
<BRK />
The Architectural Plus HVAC System calculates the leakage from the entire building in a condition in which the 
HVAC system is off and allows no temporary masking or sealing of mechanical or HVAC components such as dampers, 
flues and vents.  The Architectural plus HVAC System test should be included in the specifications of a contract 
when the building is designed such that the HVAC system may operate intermittently and when dampers will be used 
to prevent air leakage out of the conditioned space through the HVAC system.  The Architectural Plus HVAC System 
test may be applied to residential project with intermittent HVAC system operation or a project in which there 
is a need to verify mechanical dampers in the HVAC system for leakage performance.<BRK />
<BRK />
33. Indicate the allowable leakage rate of each air barrier envelope <MET>(___ L/s-m<SPS>2</SPS></MET><ENG>(___CFM/sq.ft.</ENG> @ 75 Pa).  Refer 
to UFC 3-101-01.  Use the UFC maximum allowed values or less for the Architectural Only Test.<BRK />
<BRK />
34. To the Architectural Only Test maximum leakage rate, add an allowance for the HVAC system leakage rate.  An 
arbitrary allowance of<MET> 0.25 L/s-m<SPS>2</SPS></MET><ENG> 0.05 CFM/sq.ft.</ENG> is suggested.  This higher leakage rate is the Architectural 
Plus HVAC System Test maximum leakage rate.  In other words, if the Architectural Only Test allowable leakage 
rate is X, the Architectural Plus HVAC System Test allowable leakage rate is X +<MET> 0.25 L/s-m<SPS>2</SPS></MET><ENG> 0.05 CFM/sq.ft.</ENG><BRK />
Example:<BRK />
 - Architectural Only Test: <MET> 1.27 L/s-sq m</MET><ENG> 0.25 CFM/sq.ft.</ENG> @ 75 Pa.<BRK />
 - Architectural Plus HVAC System Test: <MET> 1.5 L/s-m<SPS>2</SPS></MET><ENG> 0.30 CFM/sq.ft.</ENG> @ 75 Pa.<BRK />
<BRK />
35. Next, calculate and indicate the maximum test leakage in L/s (CFM) for each air barrier envelope and for each 
type test.  <BRK />
<BRK />
36. Renovations:  Refer to UFC 3-101-01 for requirements.  This specification is used on renovations if a major 
upgrade to the building envelope is involved.  However, the UFC offers guidance on prioritizing the sealing of 
existing building envelopes based on funding.<BRK />
<BRK />
37. Additions:  Where a new addition shares a wall with and existing building, the designer has two options:<BRK />
  a) put an air barrier assembly in the common wall and treat the new addition as a separate test zone, or<BRK />
  b) indicate that doors and other openings in the common wall will be temporarily sealed during the test, and 
identify a portion of the existing building that can be closed and pressurized with separate pressurization equipment 
so that there is no differential pressure across the common wall during the test. <BRK />
<BRK />
38. Special Design Conditions:<BRK />
<BRK />
Humidified Rooms:  A humidified space within an unhumidified building (example: computer equipment room) should 
be located as an interior room and not located on the building perimeter envelope.  Otherwise pay close attention 
to the potential for condensation within the perimeter envelope during times of cold weather.<BRK />
<BRK />
Removable Wall or Roof Panels for Equipment Installation:  Removable wall and roof panels must maintain the same 
weather and air barrier qualities as the surrounding building materials.  Removable sections must be detailed 
in a manner to be able to be resealed to the same level as originally installed.<BRK />
<BRK />
Secure Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs) and Shielded Facilities:  Coordinate compatibility of SCIF 
and/or Shielding details with the air barrier details.  It is recommended to locate such facilities at interior 
building locations away from exterior walls or provide a separation space between the protected facility and the 
exterior wall.  When using the SCIF or shielded wall at exterior locations, care must be taken to maintain consistent 
wall/ceiling temperature and proper ventilation to avoid condensation and mold problems.  Shielding materials 
must avoid use of organic adhesives, sealants, or other materials which promote mold growth.  When using shielded 
assemblies as part of the exterior building shell assembly, it is recommended to use WUFI analysis to determine 
proper assembly of materials.<BRK />

  Note: Air barrier materials will have low air permeance by definition.  However, beware of the vapor permeance 
of air barrier membranes. For example, if the air barrier material has a low vapor permeance, it may act as an 
effective vapor retarder.  With this in mind, the <BRK />
location of the membrane within the wall or roof relative to the thermal insulation becomes important.  Be sure 
that the vapor permeance and location has been considered by the design.  Perform vapor transmission calculations 
or dew point calculations as required to assure that <BRK />
moisture condensation within the building envelope will not occur.<BRK />
<BRK />
HVAC Note:  The HVAC designer should coordinate with the architectural designer regarding the indoor temperature 
and humidity conditions and the simultaneously occuring outdoor air conditions.  With this information the architectural 
designer can determine the envelope component configuration conducive to maintaining a dry thermal envelope.<BRK />

<NPR>NOTE:  Include this paragraph defining the air barrier leakage requirements whenever UFC 3-101-01 requires the 
air barrier to be tested.  If pressure testing of the air barrier system is not required, delete this paragraph.  
If pressure testing is required, on the drawings, identify the air barrier envelopes to be tested.  Provide the 
area and leakage information for each six-sided air barrier envelope to be tested below. Optionally, include a 
table on the drawings summarizing the envelope information.  If that is the approach, simply refer to the drawings 
at this point in the specification and delete the envelope area and leakage information below.<BRK />
If only a portion of the air barrier envelope is being test as in the case of the barracks building described 
in the opening notes above, indicate the test rooms; for example, change "Air Barrier Envelope 1", to "Room 214".  
For a description of the test process, Refer to UFGS <SRF>07 05 23</SRF> PRESSURE TESTING AN AIR BARRIER SYSTEM FOR AIR TIGHTNESS  
paragraph Pressure Testing a Multiple Isolated Zoned Building.  If an Air Barrier Envelope is an isolated zone 
within the larger building (eg: single room in a barracks) and if it is impossible to test that isolated zone 
without sealing the HVAC ducts that interconnect adjacent rooms, perform the Architectural Only test and delete 
the Architectural Plus HVAC System test for that particular Air Barrier Envelope.</NPR><BRK />

<TXT>The building air barrier systems must meet the following leakage  requirements.  The allowable leakage rate and the maximum leakage are at a differential 
test pressure of 75 Pa.</TXT><BRK />

<NPR>NOTE:  Edit the Allowable air leakage rates as required by UFC 3-101-01 Architecture.  A leakage value less than 
0.25 CFM/SQFT for Army/Navy facilities and 0.4 for Air Force facilities is recommended on projects where design 
and construction teams have experience in attaining lower rates of leakage to increase energy reduction, on projects 
with specific mission/functional requirements, or on building construction types (i.e pre-cast concrete panels 
and insulated concrete forms) where low allowable leakage values are easily attained.  Additionally, the leakage 
rate can be set to any leakage value less the 0.25 CFM/SQFT for Army/Navy facilities and 0.4 for Air Force facilities 
is recommended to meet project specific energy targets.  This should be correlated back to the energy model for 
validation.</NPR><BRK />

This Design Review is conceptually similar to the Design Review Report required by the TESTING, ADJUSTING, AND 
BALANCING FOR HVAC specification where the TAB specialists reviews the plans and specs and submits a report either 
indicating that the system can be balanced or describing deficiencies that preclude the TAB team from accomplishing 
their work and describing necessary changes.  Similarly, with the air barrier system Design Review, the contractor 
is asked to review the design and point out any deficiencies that prevent a successful air barrier system installation.</NPR><BRK />

of the foam. If the foam is hard to remove and leaves small bits of foam on the substrate it is called cohesive foam failure and is considered 
the best adhesion. If the foam comes away from the substrate with some force but is clean, it is called a mechanical bond. If it comes 
away easily from the substrate, the adhesion is poor. Cohesive foam failure and a good mechanical bond are acceptable.]</LST><BRK />
