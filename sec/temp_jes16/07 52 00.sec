The Guide Specification technical editors have designated those items that require Government approval, due to 
their complexity or criticality, with a "G".  Generally, other submittal items can be reviewed by the Contractor's 
Quality Control System.   Only add a &#8220;G&#8221; to an item, if the submittal is sufficiently important or complex in 
context of the project.<BRK />

For submittals requiring Government approval on Army projects, a code of up to three characters within the submittal 
tags may be used following the "G" designation to indicate the approving authority.  Codes for Army projects using 
the Resident Management System (RMS) are:  "AE" for Architect-Engineer; "DO" for District Office (Engineering 
Division or other organization in the District Office); "AO" for Area Office; "RO" for Resident Office; and "PO" 
for Project Office.  Codes following the "G" typically are not used for Navy,  Air Force, and NASA projects.<BRK />
<BRK />
The "S" following a submittal item indicates that the submittal is required for the Sustainability eNotebook to 
fulfill federally mandated sustainable requirements in accordance with Section <SRF>01 33 29</SRF> SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING.

<NTE><BRK />
<AST /><BRK />
<NPR>NOTE:  Standards such as UFC 1-200-02 promote the use of cool roofing, and increased energy conservation through 
additional insulation.  Design cool roofs following the requirements in UFC 3-110-03 "Roofing" Chapter 1, Cool 
Roofs.  Consider that when cool roofing is used with insulation R values greater than 24, the 'cool roof' surface 
has little if no influence on the energy performance of the building.  Additionally, designers should be aware 
of the possible negative impacts of using cool roofing that may result in unintended consequences.  Design mechanically-fastened 
single-ply roof systems in accordance with the requirements in UFC 3-110-03 Roofing, Chapter 2.  Condensation 
on the underside of mechanically-fastened systems can result in ice build-up in winter, mold growth on the facers, 
moisture dripping into the interior, and replacement of the roofs with less than four years of service.  See Appendix 
B of UFC 3-110-03 for more information.  Inadequate design of cool roofs in ASHRAE climate zones 4 and higher 
have resulted in the unintended consequence of condensation below the membrane-a result of the material's inability 
to warm and drive moisture downward.  Roofs that experience this condensation have had to be replaced. Other unintended 
consequences include the overheating of masonry walls, interior spaces, roof top piping and mechanical equipment 
as a result of the reflected UV rays.<BRK />

90.1 Chapter 5, for the insulation and energy performance of the building.<BRK />

NOTE:  If a cool roof is not selected in ASHRAE zones 1 thru 3, design must meet one of the exception requirements
